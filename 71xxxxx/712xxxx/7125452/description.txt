Description

Plot: THE CONFESSION is a tale of unique redemption and an exploration of good and evil featuring a hit man and a priest. On Christmas Eve, the hit man enters a church to confess his sins. Through a series of gripping flashbacks, the Confessor’s journey is revealed, laying out what has brought him to this moment and leading to a climax where his chance at ultimate redemption hangs in the balance. While at first the Confessor seems to be an evil, cold-blooded killing machine and the Priest the ultimate arbiter of good, as time passes, it becomes clear that both men are much more complicated than either could have suspected.
