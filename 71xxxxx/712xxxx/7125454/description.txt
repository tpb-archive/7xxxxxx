Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. He is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors. But for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odysseyΓÇöspanning miles and decadesΓÇötowards the time and place where she must finish what should never have begun.
