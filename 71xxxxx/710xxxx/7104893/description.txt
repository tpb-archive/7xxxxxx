appealing album, Court and Spark was Mitchell's commercial and popular triumphΓÇöit was not only 
praised by critics but was also received very warmly by the public, becoming her most successful 
album. It reached No. 2 in the United States and No. 1 in Canada and eventually received a Double 
Platinum certification by the RIAA, the highest during Mitchell's career.[5] It was voted the best 
album of the year for 1974 in The Village Voice Jazz & Pop Critics Poll.[6]. In 2003 it was listed
