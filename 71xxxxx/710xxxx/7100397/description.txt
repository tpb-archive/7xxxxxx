 Alternate Method to load the MPQs
 1. Copy the D3 Beta MPQs folder to your Hard drive directory such as c:/MPQs.
 2. Rename the copied folder as MPQ.
 3. Open config.ini with notepad thats in the Mooege folder
 4. Edit line: 
 Old - Persistent storage settings [Storage]Root = AssetsMPQRoot=${Root}/MPQ
 New - Persistent storage settings [Storage]Root = AssetsMPQRoot=C:MPQ

 This way you dont have to keep copying the D3 Beta MPQ folder to every new Mooege update. 

 All you have to do is edit the config.ini with each new update with the above example. 

 But you have to make sure you have the copied MPQ folder sitting in the C: directory of your computer so its path is C:MPQ
