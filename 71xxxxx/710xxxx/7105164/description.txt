By providing PC users with a comprehensive library of customised pre-scripted, auto-installed diagnostic routines, PC service professionals can thoroughly test systems and identify errors while the PC is still in the field. Self-help test solutions improve customer satisfaction and allows PC service organisations to reduce the numbers of PCs returned, lowering service and warranty costs so you and your customers save money.

Diagnostic tests for PC support and servicing should:

* Provide thorough, discreet, accurate and swift reviews of hardware configurations and performance
* Be designed so that PC users can run diagnostic tests independently and/or under the direction of service and support centre-based technicians to critically and reliably test the condition of their PCs
* Provide detailed and accurate results to enable service and support technicians to rapidly identify errors and failures
* Reduce the numbers of PCs returned to the service centre
* Satisfy end-users by visually verifying the condition of their PC

ΓÇªand in the field
Keeping PCs installed and in the field keeps your staff and customers happy while saving you time and money. When the PCs you support arrive bundled with Eurosoft's auto-support diagnostics, Virtual Pc-Check or Virtual QA+Win32, technical support teams can monitor and check end user's PCs for performance and faults. Best case - they will see that the problem was easy for them to fix. Worse case - they will identify the faults so your service technicians can hit the ground running when the PC is returned. Either way, you win.
When used as part of your support and repair service process, Eurosoft's diagnostic solutions ensure that your PCs are thoroughly tested whether installed or at the service depot, across the widest range of PC products. More importantly, your services will be in demand.
