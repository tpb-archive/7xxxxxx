 Following the success of Toontrack's EZmix, the new and completely         
overhauled EZmix 2 continues to build on the same fundamental idea: having    
pro-designed effect chains for instruments and channels found in every        
recording session combined in one powerful mixing tool. With the vast         
collection of ready-made presets, mixing music is not only easy and           
incredibly fast -- you end up with results second to none.                    
                                                                                
 All the previous functionality and content from EZmix is still intact and   
working in EZmix 2. The major difference however, is that the new and         
revamped version comes with settings based on high-tech mastering effects,    
new reverb algorithms, guitar/bass amp and cab simulation, a completely       
revised interface and a large core content boost. Essentially, EZmix 2 is a   
mixing engineer, mastering suite and guitar/bass amp all rolled up into one   package.
