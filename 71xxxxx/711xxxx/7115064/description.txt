It is 1942 and the German submarine fleet is heavily engaged in the so called "Battle of the Atlantic" to harass and destroy English shipping. 
With better escorts of the Destroyer Class, however, German U-Boats have begun to take heavy losses. 
"Das Boot" is the story of one such U-Boat crew, with the film examining how these submariners maintained their professionalism as soldiers, 
attempted to accomplish impossible missions, while all the time attempting to understand and obey the ideology of the government under which they served.
