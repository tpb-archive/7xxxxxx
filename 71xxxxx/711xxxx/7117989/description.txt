His pregnant wife Radha (Lalita Kumari) throws herself in the river, but is saved by a village that accepts her and her soon born son Ram (Dara Singh). After 14 long years in jail, he roams 8 long years being rejected by society and cannot find a job or assistance, then turns to violent crime. His gang is offered a large sum of money to smuggle national secrets out of the area, so he kidnaps a young child and forces her sister Roopa (Ameeta) to carry the goods. Roopa would rather die than become a traitor, loses control of her car and is cast into the river, washing ashore in the same village with Radha and Ram. Meanwhile, unemployed Kishore (Kishore Kumar) decides he will play detective to find the lost girl Radha and her sister, tracks her to the village and falls in love.
