2)  Rebellion to Revolution 
-- Rebellion escalates into war with the Battle at Bunker Hill. The Continental Congress establishes an army and appoints George Washington as Commander-in-Chief. The army surrounds the British troops that occupy Boston, and Britain sends additional troops and its three best generals -- William Howe, John Burgoyne and Henry Clinton -- to take over command. The Continental assault from Dorchester Heights forces the British and loyalists to evacuate the city.
