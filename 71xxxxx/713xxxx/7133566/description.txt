The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 25 March 2012


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with pastor and author Lindsey Williams about the timeline on the financial crash, what currency is a safe bet, and why Obama may not be re-elected due to his involvement in Keystone Pipeline. 

Alex also covers the latest news items, including the latest revelations on Jon Corzine and the MF swindle, sagging morale at Big Sis' Department of Homeland Security, an effort by the globalists to allow their Green Climate Fund front to operate around the world with immunity, and developments in the Trayvon Martin case as victimhood and reverse racism opportunists turn the unfortunate death of a teenager into a possible race war.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
