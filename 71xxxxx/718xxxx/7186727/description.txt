Romanian The:Egocentrics are another interesting newcomer in 2010 - they offer a mix of stoner, post and psych/space rock provided with a proper progressive essence. Which means there is much more than a simple stoner flavour in here - even though the band is often reduced to this category. Now released on the famous German NASONI label 'Love Fear Choices And Astronauts' comprises four lengthy tracks beyond the ten minute mark, totally instrumental. Rather varied jams, constantly mixing up heavy psych and cosmic floating parts.

When you ask about the uniqueness, the aspect what differentiates them from other bands I would say it's Brenn's guitar work offering a great bandwith. Best described for the opener Spacewulf where he plays a very sensitive part. 2012 however starts with a heavier, rather Jimi Hendrix related style, later though evolving into another spacey mood. Don't know why exactly, but Bright Dawn Of The Soul reminds me of Robin Trower's best days (Bridge Of Sighs) in parts ... from the heavier side of life too ... but again you won't miss a gliding relaxed excursion included in between.

The last minutes of Mystic Initiation then offer a gripping space rock interlude underlaid with samples, the album highlight in my opinion. 3 and a half stones ... ehh, stars ... are well deserved for this solid production. To name comparable bands for a proper orientation I would choose Samsara Blues Experiment, My Sleeping Karma, Earthless ...
