Description......: To the Nazis of WWII, film was a weapon used to justify murder 
                   and even genocide. Joseph Goebbels, the head of the Nazi 
                   propaganda machine, personally commissioned The Titanic; he 
                   saw it as a potent weapon in demonizing the English. In his 
                   pursuit of creating what was to be the Third Reich's cinematic 
                   masterpiece he was ruthless. He had the first director 
                   murdered and poured in unrivalled resources even bringing 
                   troops back from the front to use as extras. The film was 
                   intended to show German valor and Allied weakness, but when it 
                   was finished it portrayed an entirely different message. It 
                   had become an allegory for Nazism itself. There was an all too 
                   apparent parallel of a country heading towards its own iceberg 
                   and sinking. The story of the Nazi Titanic had an unpleasant 
                   sting in its tail. The boat used to play the Titanic in the 
                   film, the Cap Arcona, was sunk by allied bombers with an even 
                   greater loss of life than the original ship.
