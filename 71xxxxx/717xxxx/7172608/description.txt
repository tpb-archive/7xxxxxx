RELEASE NOTES
 In this side-scrolling action game, you play as Scarygirl - a girl who
 has been adopted by a giant intelligent octopus and is trying to figure
 out who the man haunting her dreams is. Traverse unique, extremely
 vibrant, colorful, and magical worlds in a seamless mix of 2D and 3D
 platforming action. You can go it alone in single-player mode or grab a
 friend and team up in co-op gameplay and fight alongside Bunniguru
 the giant kung-fu rabbit. And as you advance, you ll be able to
 purchase new weapons and new moves, and discover countless secrets
 along the way. It s a mesmerizing fairytale, but the creepy-cute
 tough-as-nails Scarygirl is no damsel in distress!
