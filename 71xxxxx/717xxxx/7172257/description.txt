  Concert:   A  standard show from these days which doesn`t offer anything new. Elvis and band are in good spirits and deliver a solid performance. We have an interesting setlist with highlights like Steamroller Blues, What Now My Love or American Trilogy. Recommendable ! (Ciscoking)   


With covers! Enjoy!
