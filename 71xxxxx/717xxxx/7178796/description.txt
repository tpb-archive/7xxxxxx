"Al Qaeda and the Global War on Terrorism"

with Michel Chossudovsky.

The broad consequences of 9/11 with regard to US military doctrine, and more broadly the pretext and justification which the lies surrounding 9/11 have given to waging a war of conquest under the banner of what we call the Global War on Terrorism; Libya, Syria; Q and A.

This is an address originally given on September 11, 2011, and originally broadcast by Guns and Butter on November 30, 2011.




================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
