THE MOVIE...

Winter, 1988: Harrisburg PA's celebrity weatherman,
Russ Richards, is broke: he's borrowed heavily to open
a snowmobile dealership, and it's still
unseasonably warm. Gig, his seedy pal, advises him to run an
insurance scam; when it goes awry, Russ is out another
$10,000 and in trouble with Dale, a bat-wielding thug.
Gig convinces Russ to rig the state lottery with the help
of Crystal, a gold-digging ditz with a heart of tin. They
have to find a beard to buy the ticket, and then they have to cash it.
Soon, murder and various double-crosses add to Russ's
nightmare. A lazy cop zeroes in. Jail is closer than riches.
Will Russ have to choose between his money and his life?
