Grell Sutcliff is requested by Madame Red to train under Sebastian. It is later revealed by Tanaka that the Phantomhive estate was previous burned down three years ago, in which Ciel's parents died in the fire. Elizabeth Middleford, Ciel's fiancée, arrives at the estate for a visit. Although Ciel does not wish to dance with her, Sebastian convinces him to learn to dance for the sake of preserving his social reputation, and teaches him the simple Viennese waltz. Elizabeth later unhappily shatters Ciel's family ring on the flor, since she had already chosen a ring for him, though she is absentminded when realizing its value to him. Nonetheless, Ciel throws the family ring out the window, declaring his status as head of the family, with or without it. Ciel then asks a teary-eyed Elizabeth to dance with him. Later that night, Sebastian finds Ciel depressed in bed and restores the family ring undamaged. Ciel wonders how many generations have died wearing the ring. He tells Sebastian to stay by his side until he falls asleep, amusing Sebastian, who comments on Ciel showing his weaknesses to him.
