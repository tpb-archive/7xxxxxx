Lyrics:

[Demi Lovato]
I've always been the kind of girl
That hid my face
So afraid to tell the world
What I've got to say

But I have this dream
Bright inside of me
I'm gonna let it show, it's time
To let you know, to let you know

[Refrão]
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light shine on me

Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

[Demi Lovato]
Do you know what it's like
To feel so in the dark?
To dream about a life
Where you're the shining star

Even though it seems
Like is too far away
I have to believe in myself
It's the only way

[Refrão]
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light shine on me

Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

[Joe Jonas]
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you, I gotta find you

You're the missing piece
I need the song inside on me
I need to find you, I gotta find you

[Refrão]
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light shine on me

Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

[Joe Jonas]
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing

Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me
