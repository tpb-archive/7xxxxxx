Bizarre Magazine UK May 2012

Bizarre is a self-described ΓÇ£alternativeΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£non-mainstreamΓÇ¥ magazine. 
It is a sister publication to Fortean Times. It has no connection to the 
fetish publication also known as ΓÇ£BizarreΓÇ¥ published between 1946-1959. 
The magazine has a wide variety of features and articles which include 
unusual news events from around the world, drug usage, different types 
of fetishistic and deviant behavior, interviews with famous counter 
culture figures and showcases of cult directors, musicians and authors. 
Bizarre has also covered legislation regarding sex offences and civil 
liberties, along with issues like censorship and human rights abuses, 
both domestically and abroad. It has also started a campaign to raise 
awareness of prejudice towards subcultures following the murder of 
Sophie Lancaster. From the start the publication had much in common 
with more mainstream ladΓÇÖs mags, typically featuring a semi-nude model 
on the front cover, nude photography in special sealed ΓÇÿx ratedΓÇÖ sections 
inside, and frequent reviews of weird gadgets, films, music, and websites. 
They regularly cover art, gay culture, the avant-garde and the Cinema of 
Transgression in their art and music reviews.
