Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, April 17 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with researcher, author and radio talk show host Alan Watt. His latest book in the Cutting Through series is Esoteric Unveiled and the Meaning of Revelations in the High Masonic Tradition. 

Alex also covers the news, including developments in the shooting of baby pigs on livestock ranches by Michigan's jack-booted Department of Natural Resources. 

He also talks about the IRS revoking passports, including possibly those of 30,000 soldiers, and the CISPA internet control bill moving through Congress.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
