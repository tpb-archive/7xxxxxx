Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawling role playing game with an oldschool heart but a modern execution.
A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile
crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captors, the mountain is riddled with ancient
tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see
daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through
the mountain, level by level.

The game brings back the oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement,
devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters. Legend of Grimrock puts
an emphasis on puzzles and exploration and the wits and perception of the player are more important tools
than even the sharpest of swords could be. And if you are a hardened dungeon crawling veteran and you crave
an extra challenge, you can arm yourself with a stack of grid paper and turn on the Oldschool Mode which
disables the luxury of the automap! Are you ready to venture forth and unravel the mysteries of Mount
Grimrock?
