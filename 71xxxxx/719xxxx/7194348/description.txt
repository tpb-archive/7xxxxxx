Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bopup Observer is a secure one-way messenger designed for alerting and 
notification purposes. This clear, easy to use and light-weight IM 
client can be deployed on LAN or enterprise-size networks and helps you 
keep users informed and updated instantly. 

The messenger supports rich-text messages including links, font and 
color formatting, emoticons, and it can receive files and directories 
from the IM server and other users. You can get urgent messages or 
activate the Confirmation Mode on the IM server that pops up the program 
when a message is received and keeps it on top until the user clicks the 
Confirm Message button. 

Messaging and File Transfer are encrypted with strong algorithms so that 
personal and group conversations are safe and secure even if you receive 
messages and files via the Internet. You will never lose any information 
you receive because offline messages and transfers are stored and 
automatically delivered by the server when the recipient goes online. 

No user experience and skills are needed to use the program. The smart 
and comfortable user interface with advanced usability options and popup 
notifications allows you to join the IM network in a few mouse clicks. 
The messenger completely supports the Terminal Server/Citrix environment 
and can be used simultaneously by multiple users on one computer. Bopup 
Observer can automatically download and install updates from the IM 
server. 

The centralized client/server architecture offers complete and flexible 
management for controlling your IM infrastructure. The central server 
logs all user activity and archives all messages and file transfers with 
the reporting, search and printing options. It allows you to manage 
messaging groups, users' contact information and permissions to send and 
view other users, assign and distribute important files and documents to 
users. It is easy to import user accounts from your Active Directory 
(LDAP) and start an efficient Instant Messaging system right now.
