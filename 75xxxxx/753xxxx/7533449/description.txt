For Windows Users, try the K-lite codec pack. Make sure that you select 

Windows Media Player for the .mp4 options. If you installed it properly when 

you play them with WMP an icon will appear in the notification area on the 

taskbar.

For Linux and Mac users you might have to research better codecs

For PS3 or XBOX 360 owners put the race on a flashdrive or external hard 

drive and play it with them
