Bestselling author Chris Mooney uses cutting-edge research to explain the psychology behind why todayΓÇÖs Republicans reject realityΓÇöit's just part of who they are.
From climate change to evolution, the rejection of mainstream science among Republicans is growing, as is the denial of expert consensus on the economy, American history, foreign policy and much more. Why won't Republicans accept things that most experts agree on? Why are they constantly fighting against the facts?

Science writer Chris Mooney explores brain scans, polls, and psychology experiments to explain why conservatives today believe more wrong things; appear more likely than Democrats to oppose new ideas and less likely to change their beliefs in the face of new facts; and sometimes respond to compelling evidence by doubling down on their current beliefs.  

Goes beyond the standard claims about ignorance or corporate malfeasance to discover the real, scientific reasons why Republicans reject the widely accepted findings of mainstream science, economics, and historyΓÇöas well as many undeniable policy facts (e.g., there were no ΓÇ£death panelsΓÇ¥ in the health care bill).
Explains that the political parties reflect personality traits and psychological needsΓÇöwith Republicans more wedded to certainty, Democrats to noveltyΓÇöand this is the root of our divide over reality.
Written by the author of The Republican War on Science, which was the first and still the most influential book to look at conservative rejection of scientific evidence. But the rejection of science is just the beginningΓÇª
Certain to spark discussion and debate, The Republican Brain also promises to add to the lengthy list of persuasive scientific findings that Republicans reject and deny.
