Why Hide My IP
When connecting to the Internet, the computer (or network router) is assigned a public IP address. As you visit websites, that IP address is transmitted and recorded in log files kept on those servers. Access logs leave behind a trail of your Internet activity. It is quite necessary to hide your real IP address, if you do not want to be traced by others.
