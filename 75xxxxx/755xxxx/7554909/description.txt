Amateur Photographer is the world's oldest consumer weekly photographic magazine, first hitting the newsstands on October 10 1884. Since then, AP (as it is affectionately known to its readers) has been the bible for both amateur and professional photo-enthusiasts around the world. It has helped generations of photographers to improve their skills.
