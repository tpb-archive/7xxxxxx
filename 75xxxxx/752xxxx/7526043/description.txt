PLOT:

  170 Hz is a film about unconditional love and the freedom that goes with it. 
  Nick and Evy are two adolescents who fall hopelessly in love with each      
  other. Their love has no voice or sound as they are both deafmute. They     
  have their own ways of communicating with each other, so while being in     
  love already makes them stand apart from the rest of the world, in the      
  splendid isolation of their soundless love they distance themselves from    
  their surroundings even more. When they sense that their parents do not     
  fully agree with them being together, they develop an audacious plan: they  
  will flee and hide in a special place, where Evy will become pregnant and   
  have a baby - they are convinced that once they have a child together       
  nothing and nobody will be able to keep them apart. Nick takes the          
  initiative and drives off with Evy to the hiding place he has meticulously  
  prepared, the wreck of a former Soviet submarine in a distant part of the   
  harbour. Within that metal casing full of sounds and tremors they cannot    
  hear, but with their strongly developed remaining senses, can feel all the  
  more. They concentrate on their baby project. But in that cage of happiness 
  Evy slowly discovers that Nick had another reason to disappear.
