Sore Screams | Elise Graves
August 12, 2011
Elise Graves always screams the best when she has a hood over her face. The claustrophobic confines allow just enough air flow to let her put her lungs to work. It is amazing that she does not go hoarse. Of course if she ever stops yelling PD will just take it as a sign that she needs to be beaten more. If her options are a little sore throat or the worst that he can manage it is clear which one she will choose.
