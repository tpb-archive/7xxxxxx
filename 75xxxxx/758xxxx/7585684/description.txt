After six years as a guest of the state, mob hit man Jason Reed wants nothing more than to get an honest job and spend time with his young son, Tommy. He is not ten steps outside of the prison before being greeted by Keither, an old crony anxious to pick up where they left off. While out for a drive with his son, Jason saves a young woman from a gun wielding thug, not realizing that he has just managed to ruin Keith's plans to recover some stolen heroin. While fending off various retaliatory attacks from his old buddies, Jason must also deal with his ex-wife, a reformed drug addict who has returned from out of nowhere intent on re-uniting with Tommy
