By Thomas Ott

Thomas Ott plunges into the darkness with five new graphic horror novelettes - 'The Prophet', 'The Wonder Pill', 'La Lucha', 'The Hotel', and the title story, each executed in his hallucinatory and hyper-detailed scratchboard style and running between 16 to 20 pages.

The first story in the book introduces the other four - A little girl visits an amusement park. She looks fascinated, but finds everything too expensive. Finally, behind the rollercoaster she eyeballs a small booth with 'CINEMA PANOPTICUM' written on it. Inside there are boxes with screens. Every box contains a movie; the title of each appears on each screen. Each costs only a dime, so the price is right for the little girl. She puts her money in the first box: "The Prophet" begins. In the film, a vagrant foresees the end of the world and tries to warn people, but nobody believes him. They will soon enough.

In the second film, 'The Wonderpill', a short-sighted man initially goes blind from some pills his doctor gave him, but soon the blindness wears off and he finds they accord quite a view. 'La Lucha', the third story, introduces a Mexican wrestler who fights against death himself. In a typical Ott twist, he wins and loses at the same time. The final story, 'The Hotel', depicts a traveler who goes to sleep in what seems to be an otherwise empty hotel. His awakening is the stuff of nightmares.

Ott's O' Henry-esque plot twists will delight fans of classic horror like The Twilight Zone and Tales From the Crypt, his artwork will haunt you long after you've put the book down.
