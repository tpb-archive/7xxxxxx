AirParrot 1.0.4 for Windows

Cracked and working again :)

Install

after installation copy crackeado1 and crackeado2 to app dir, open crackeado1 put anything you want for serial and hit ok, it should show "Thank you for purchasing AirParrot" :P then close it from the little icon that is next to the clock....

after doing all that open crackeado2 it shouldn't show anything like a window when opened, just the icon next to the clock, from that icon you can configure program options...

if all that happens, then you can delete original airparrot.exe and crackeado1.exe, and rename crackeado2.exe to airparrot.exe
