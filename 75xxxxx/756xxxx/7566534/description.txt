IP Net Checker (Formerly IP Monitor) is a network
monitoring software that allows you to verify the network
connectivity of IP hosts on the Internet and LAN. The
program periodically pings, checks TCP ports or check HTTP
on user specified computers (workstations, servers) or
other network devices (routers). It is able to monitor IP
and show notifications when the states of some computers
change. You can also view and access shared folders, open
web and ftp, ping, trace rout and sending messages. IP Net
Checker can generate status log files
