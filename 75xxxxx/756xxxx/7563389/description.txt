Dark Souls is the new action role-playing game from the developers who
brought you Demon's Souls, FromSoftware. Dark Souls will have many
familiar features: A dark fantasy universe, tense dungeon crawling
fearsome enemy encounters and unique online interactions. Dark Souls is a
spiritual successor to Demon's, not a sequel. Prepare for a new
despair-inducing world, with a vast, fully-explorable horizon and
vertically-oriented landforms. Prepare for a new, mysterious story
centered around the the world of Lodran, but most of all, prepare to die
You will face countless murderous traps, countless darkly grotesque mobs
and several gargantuan, supremely powerful demons and dragons bosses. You
must learn from death to persist through this unforgiving world. And you
aren t alone. Dark Souls allows the spirits of other players to show up in
your world, so you can learn from their deaths and they can learn from
yours. You can also summon players into your world to co-op adventure, or
invade other's worlds to PVP battle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which
serve as check points as you fight your way through this epic adventure
While rested at Bonfires, your health and magic replenish but at a cost
all mobs respawn. Beware: There is no place in Dark Souls that is truly
safe. With days of game play and an even more punishing difficulty level
Dark Souls will be the most deeply challenging game you play this year
Can you live through a million deaths and earn your legacy?
