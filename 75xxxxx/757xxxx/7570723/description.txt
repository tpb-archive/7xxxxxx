Going to California is a concert performance video by the British pop group Tears for Fears. Released in 1990, it is a recording of the band's show at the Santa Barbara County Bowl in May 1990 during their "Seeds of Love" World Tour.
The performance also features American vocalist/pianist Oleta Adams who had worked with the band on their album The Seeds Of Love and joined them for the subsequent world tour.
Going to California was initially released on VHS home video and Laserdisc, and was later released on DVD in 2005 as an "extra feature" on the band's Scenes from the Big Chair documentary DVD, complete with an updated 5.1 soundtrack audio option.
It was re-released (by itself) on DVD in 2009 as Tears for Fears - Live from Santa Barbara, which featured twelve of the tracks (the original 1990 release had sixteen). An audio CD version was also released simultaneously under the same title.
