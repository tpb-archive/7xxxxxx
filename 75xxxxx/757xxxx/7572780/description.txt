 "The Xtra Factor"airs on ITV2 in the United Kingdom. It is the sister show to 
 "The X Factor". The series is hosted by Ben Shepherd and shows extra footage 
 from the auditions and has interviews with the contestants. The series also 
 features live interviews with the performers after they have been voted off 
 the main ITV show. The fourth series saw Fearne Cotton take over as host.
 
 
 coming up next and the credits was cut off (not really needed nor important!) 
                                          
                                 Enjoy!
