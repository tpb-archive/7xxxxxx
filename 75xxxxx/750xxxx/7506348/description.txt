The broad acceptance and use of this book as one of the leading introductory computer graphics texts has enabled the original author and coauthors to update the chapters and contribute new material involving the most knowledgeable experts in different areas while maintaining a unified approach. This edition of "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics" adds four new contributed chapters and contains substantial reorganizations and improvements to the core material. The new chapters add coverage of implicit modeling and of two important graphics applications: games and information visualization. The fourth new contributed chapter is a major upgrade to the material on color science. As with the chapters added in the second edition, we have chosen the contributors both for their expertise and for their clear way of expressing ideas.
