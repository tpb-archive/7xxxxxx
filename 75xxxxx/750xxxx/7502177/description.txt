Sliders-12: Externalization of the Kryst; Secrets of the Tan'-Tri-A'jha. PART-1: The 7 Suns of Cos-MA'-yah, Keys of Aden, Budding of the Lotus Seed and Plasma Body Initiation.ΓÇ¿Recorded December 30, 2011 at the Festival of Lights Workshop, Sarasota FL
This first of three Sliders-12 workshops involved yet another ΓÇ£Mission UpgradeΓÇ¥ (MUG), this time an expedited activation of the Tan-Tri-Ajha Shield, and a Graduation Ceremony for all (for becoming Adashi Adepts) and wonderful information on the Secret Anatomy of an Adashi Adept. The expedited activations are occurring because ONE, we are ready (!) and TWO, the Fallen teamsΓÇÖ plans to cause a calamitous effect in the Aquafereion shield with an activation called the Dark Flower Activation have already started and are building momentum. The Adashi Adept graduation involves a specific activation of the Light Body Chakra System and Plasma Body, an activation that is being brought through by the Phim Families of the Adashi Adepts (include the Ma-jhi-Ta Benders introduced in the Sliders-11), many of whom are incarnates on Earth. The Phim race lines have experienced a Krystar Turn-around and have reached Adashi-3 Master level and because of this, can incarnate directly from the DhA-Ya-TEi Planes (Adashi masters co-create and live within the DhA-Ya-TEi Planes). Humans on Earth who have Phim coding in their DNA can activate their Light Body anatomy to the level of an Adashi Master, and then continue to activate their Plasma Body. They can then assist in transferring this Plasma Body activation to other non-Phim race lines on NET Earth and other areas of the Milky Way through a ΓÇÿhost linkΓÇÖ (involves a link through the Hydro-Acoustic Body and the DhA-Ya-fication process). This way all non-Phims will be able to acquire a sheath of protection from the Dark Flower Activation, open their own Krystar Line and activate their Lotus Flower anatomy.
