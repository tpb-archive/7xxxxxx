"Sacred Heart is happy to host the Pines in concert to celebrate the release of their new CD Dark So Gold.

Rising out of the prairies of the Midwest, The Pines are one of the most distinct and powerful indie-rock/Americana groups to hit the national scene in years. Emerging from the same Minneapolis music world that spawned such notable acts as The Jayhawks, The Replacements and Bob Dylan, The Pines have gathered a stunning line-up of musical talent, in both their live shows and on record, that has gained them a faithful and growing following. Frontmen Benson Ramsey and David Huckfelt share a common musical language rooted in the songs and songwriters of their native Iowa, while each bringing a distinct voice and sensibility to the sound that Rolling Stone senior writer David Fricke called ΓÇ£quietly grippingΓÇ¥ stark-country. The mysterious sound of The Pines fuses BensonΓÇÖs ethereal, otherworldly, heart-piercing songs with DavidΓÇÖs earthy, darkly romantic and rough-hewn visionary tales. With masterful guitar work, beautiful vocals and the graceful keyboard and vocal additions of BensonΓÇÖs brother Alex Ramsey, the core of The PinesΓÇÖ sound captivates and elevates with rare intimacy.

A great live act whether performing as a stripped-down trio (David Huckfelt, Benson Ramsey and Alex Ramsey) or as a full rock band, The PinesΓÇÖ devoted cult following and has led them to share the stage with such diverse acts as Bon Iver, Mavis Staples, The Arcade Fire, Iris DeMent, Mason Jennings and Spider John Koerner. The Pines just finished a North American tour with Mason Jennings in twenty-five cities, opening for him and playing in his band.

In 2012, they will be hitting the road again, touring in support of their new album. They will also be showcasing at this yearΓÇÖs South By Southwest (SXSW) Conference, where they have been a big hit with both critics and fans. For their full schedule, please visit www.thepinesmusic.com or www.redhouserecords.com.

Opening the show will be Erik Koskinen, a multi- talented singer, songwriter, guitarist and producer known for his solo work and participation in bands such as Dead Man Winter and Molly Maher and Her Disbelievers."
