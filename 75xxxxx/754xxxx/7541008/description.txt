Description:

Go beyond the movie to experience what it's like to BE Spider-Man like never before. Set shortly after the events of Columbia Pictures' new film, The Amazing 

Spider-Man throws New York City's brand new hero back into free-roaming, web-slinging action, as he protects the Big Apple from a deluge of unimaginable 

threats. Experience the new Web Rush mechanic as Spidey twists his way through the NYC skyline with unprecedented speed and grace. The game's original story 

also explores beautiful indoor environments, as you'll encounter everything from skirmishes with everyday street thugs to pulse-pounding confrontations with 

Spider-Man's most lethal foes.
