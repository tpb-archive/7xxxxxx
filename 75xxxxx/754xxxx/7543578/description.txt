Journey to the Stars began as a planetarium show produced by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and supported by NASA's Heliophysics Division. It surveys the mind-boggling variety of stars that dot the cosmosâ€”exploding stars, giant stars, dwarf stars, neutron stars, even our own star! A New York Times reviewer called it "easily the most beautiful planetarium show I have ever seen." Journey has been playing to packed houses at the Hayden Planetarium in New York since the summer of 2009 and, by popular demand, has now been copied to DVD.

The show is narrated by Academy Award-winning actress Whoopi Goldberg. "There it goes!" she calls out as a supernova explodes on the screen. "Talk about star power." Her otherworldly voice propels the audience through time and space on a journey you soon forget is merely virtual. It is as immersive as a DVD can be.
