Speed Up PC With BoostSpeed

Keep Disk and Registry Clean

Keep your PC fast and safe
BoostSpeed will detect most of the popular \"PC-slowers\" - bundle-software (such as eDonkey or Kazaa) which silently download malware and spyware to your computer, taking up internet traffic and slowing down the system. This will also keep your system safe from prying eyes of spyware programs.
