The base FlightGear package contains only a small subset of the aircraft that are available for FlightGear. Developers have created a wide range of aircraft, from WWII fighters like the Spitfire, to passenger planes like the Boeing 747. 

Simply download the files and uncompress them into the data/Aircraft subdirectory of your installation. The aircraft are downloaded as .zip files. Once you have uncompressed them, there will be a new sub-directory in your data/Aircraft directory containing the aircraft. Next time you run FlightGear, the new aircraft will be available.

On Mac OS X, you may use the GUI launcher to install the downloaded aircraft files
