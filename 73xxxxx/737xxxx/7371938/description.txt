[Chorus]
Love is nice when itΓÇÖs understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll (x5)

[Flo Rida]
ItΓÇÖs like Woodstock city, brand new billion
And bark to the music, sucker than a psychic
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrick
Walk to a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my lambo, strikes and a visit
To meeting in the rain, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know
When the party gon' stop, let the good times roll
Come on letΓÇÖs go, you got another minute
Get the party on the roll, ainΓÇÖt nothing like the feeling
When youΓÇÖre winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one love
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ainΓÇÖt ready cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like you know, just what to do
When the good times roll

[Chorus]
Love is nice when itΓÇÖs understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll (x5)

Roll is on, everybody come to get the taste of the bomb
Feeling wild shopper when youΓÇÖre bad to the bone
Gotta be the hottest when you shine like chrome
Gotta find that tone, has a mind of its own
Love while IΓÇÖm sposed to look around and itΓÇÖs gone
Love while IΓÇÖm sposed to up hold it down for this crown
Just like her, IΓÇÖm already gone,
Let the good times go

All I wanna lock, lock, up in this drop top
Pull up in the Chevy so classy and hot, hot, hot
Pockets full and heavy got you screaming what you got got
What you tryna say, I know I already rock, rock
Gotta let go, pedal to the floor
So incredible, so much better with the flow
Ready for the show, like i'm singing hey yo
Do it like a pro, let the good times roll, roll, roll, roll...

And letΓÇÖs go all night, all night
Wake up the club and letΓÇÖs go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast for the good times
Where they last forever, weΓÇÖre youngs, yeah the good times
Raise your glass, letΓÇÖs all have some fun

[Chorus]
Love is nice when itΓÇÖs understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll (x5)

thanks
