SYNOPSIS:
Daniel Hardman is back, and he's waging a war for the hearts and minds of the Pearson Hardman employees. Hoping to shore up support amongst the voting partners, Jessica sends Harvey to court Paul Porter, the head of the bankruptcy department. Paul isn't pleased with Jessica's treatment of him over the last few years, but if Harvey can help convince an architect client that it's time to pull the plug on his half-built passion project and file for bankruptcy, Paul will consider throwing his weight behind the current managing partner.

At the same time, Mike, newly single and flying high from Rachel's voice-mail, puts all his effort into rekindling his romance with the alluring paralegal. But as his guilt begins to weigh on him, Mike considers coming clean to Rachel, even if it means risking not only his own position, but Harvey and Jessica's as well.

Meanwhile, convincing Paul Porter's client to listen to reason proves harder than Harvey first thought. Switching gears, Harvey and Mike soon hatch an audacious plan that will allow the architect to forego bankruptcy and continue to build. However, Paul isn't happy with having his case hijacked, which means that Harvey may have to make a choice between the big win and the bigger picture...
