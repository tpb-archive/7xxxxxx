
Goin' under, Rats In The Cellar
 Goin' under, skin's turnin' yellow
 Nose is runny, losin' my connection
 Losin' money, getting no affection
 
New York City blues
 East side, West side lose
 Throw me in the slam
 Catch me if you can
 Believe
 That you're wearing
 Tearing me apart
 
Safe complaining, 'cause everything's rotten
 Go insanin', and ain't a thing forgotten
 Feelin' cozy, Rats In The Cellar
 Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow
 Loose and soggy, lookin' mighty lazy
 Consume my body, pushin up a-daisies
 
New York City schools
 East side, west side lose
 Throw me in the slam
 Catch me if you can
 Believe
 That you're wearing
 Tearing me apart

 Catch me if you can
