
In this article, I will be examining the following processes:
How people are encouraged to study with Jehovah's Witnesses
How people are encouraged to join, gel baptised, and participate
How people are discouraged from leaving the Witnesses

I will say very little about the validity of the doctrine of the Watchtower Society. This has been discussed in great detail elsewhere (particularly on other web sites about the Witnesses which scrutinize the specifics of their doctrine).

AUDIENCE: This article was written for people who have been approached by the Witnesses and want to know what to expect. It may also interest people who are already Witnesses and are starting to wonder why they joined.
