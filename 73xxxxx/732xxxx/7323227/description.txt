Spencer Grant had no idea what drew him to the bar with the red door. 
He thought he would just sit down, have a slow beer or two, and talk to a stranger. He couldnΓÇÖt know that it would lead to a narrow escape from a bungalow targeted by a SWAT team. Or that it would leave him a wanted man. 

Now he is on the run from mysterious and ruthless men. He is in love with a woman he knows next to nothing about. And he is hiding from a past he canΓÇÖt fully remember. 

On his trail is a shadowy security agency that answers to no one ΓÇô including the U.S. government, and a man who considers himself a compassionate Angel of Death. But worst of all, Spencer Grant is on a collision course with inner demons he thought he had buried years ago, inner demons that could destroy him if his enemies donΓÇÖt first.
