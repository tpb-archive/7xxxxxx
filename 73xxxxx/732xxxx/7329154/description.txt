There was no chance of rain stopping play today as performers prepared for Britain's biggest Jubilee street party - a free concert for 10,000 to be held outside Buckingham Palace tonight. 

Kylie Minogue donned a plastic poncho as she rehearsed her set in the rain ahead of tonight's spectacular, tweeting the words 'Jubilee rehearsals #wetwetwet' to her followers.

The concert will be headlined by ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, who was present at the soundcheck this afternoon, prompting concert organiser Gary Barlow to tweet that he felt like a 'complete beginner' next to the rock legend.

Also set to perform later tonight is a world-class line-up of musical stars including Sir Elton John, as well as current chart toppers Jessie J and Ed Sheeran.
