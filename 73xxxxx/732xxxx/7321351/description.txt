50 Cent - In Da Club Lyrics:

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, shawty
'Cause it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a ****
It's not your birthday!

[Chorus: x2]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love 
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed 

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty knives in the club
*****s heard I **** with Dre, now they want to show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they want to **** 
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that ***** roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them *****s'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend want to get bi and they ready to go

[Chorus: x2]

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things 
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, *****, I came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
***** you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot *** ***** trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya *****, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the ************ burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the *****s hate then let 'em hate 
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub
You know where we ****ing be

[Chorus: x2]

Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either, *****
In the club all the time, *****, so it's a problem pop off, *****
