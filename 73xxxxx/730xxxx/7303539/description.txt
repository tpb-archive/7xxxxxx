Storyline

Shaggy, Scooby-Doo, and the Mystery Inc. gang hit the bodacious beaches of Hawaii for the Big Kahuna of Hanahuna Surfing Contest--only to discover there's a terribly real monster about to show all the true meaning of wipeout! The locals are convinced that island spirits are furious over a new resort being built on sacred ground and when an army of tiny demons attacks the surfers, the ancient properties appear to be true. Could this be the first mystery that Daphne finally can't figure out before trouble--in the form of a huge volcano--erupts?
