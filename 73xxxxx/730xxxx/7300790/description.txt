 Lyrics:

 [LIAM PAYNE:]
 I've tried playing it cool
 But when I'm looking at you
 I can't ever be brave
 'Cause you make my heart race

 [HARRY STYLES:]
 Shot me out of the sky
 You're my kryptonite
 You keep making me weak
 Yeah, frozen and can't breathe

 [ZAYN MALIK:]
 Something's gotta give now
 Cause I'm dying just to make you see
 That I need you here with me now
 Cause you've got that one thing

 [EVERYONE:]
 So get out, get out, get out of my head
 And fall into my arms instead
 I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
 But I need that one thing
 And you've got that one thing

 [NIALL HORAN:]
 Now I'm climbing the walls
 But you don't notice at all
 That I'm going out of my mind
 All day and all night

 [LOUIS TOMLINSON & ZAYN MALIK IN BACKGROUND:]
 Somethings' gotta give now
 Cause I'm dying just to know your name
 And I need you here with me now
 Cause you've got that one thing

 [EVERYONE:]
 So get out, get out, get out of my head
 And fall into my arms instead
 I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
 But I need that one thing

 [EVERYONE:]
 Get out, get out, get out of my mind
 And come on, come into my life
 I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
 But I need that one thing
 And you've got that one thing

 [EVERYONE:]
 Woah (Clapping)

 [HARRY STYLES:]
 You've got that one thing

 [LIAM PAYNE:]
 Get out, get out, get out of my head
 And fall into my arms instead

 [EVERYONE:]
 So get out, get out, get out of my head
 And fall into my arms instead
 I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
 But I need that one thing

 [EVERYONE:]
 Get out, get out, get out of my mind
 And come on, come into my life
 I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
 But I need that one thing
 And you've got that one thing
