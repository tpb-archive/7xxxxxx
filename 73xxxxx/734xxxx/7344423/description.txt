The film is based on a purportedly true story, which has since become one of the most famous "time slips". The two ladies' real names were Annie Charlotte Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain, who at the time occupied high teaching positions within Oxford University. The script is based on their book "An Adventure" (1911) which was published under assumed names. Written by BlueGreen
