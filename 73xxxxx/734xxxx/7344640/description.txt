For Windows Users, try the K-lite codec pack. Make sure that you select Windows Media Player for the .mp4 options. If you installed it properly when you play them with WMP an icon will appear in the notification area on the taskbar.

For Linux and Mac users you might have to research better codecs

For PS3 or XBOX 360 owners put the race on a flashdrive or external hard drive and play it with them
