Hello, this is Dylan Gallus composer and leader of Eternal Glory. I did have plans to sell my album, but I had second thoughts since I\'m a pirate myself and it would be a bit hypicritical. So my great friend FuctUpPunk, a well known and very well respected pirate has taken on the great efforts of uploading my album for all of you can download it for free. I really hope all of you enjoy this album as much as I did making it. Sit back, relax, and enjoy! 
Thanks to all the downloaders, new and old fans, and last but not least, FuctUpPunk!
