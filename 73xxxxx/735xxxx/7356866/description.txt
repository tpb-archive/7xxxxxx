Breaking Bad is an American television drama series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The series is currently broadcast in the United States and Canada on the cable channel AMC and is a production of Sony Pictures Television. It premiered on January 20, 2008. To date, three seasons comprising 33 episodes have aired. The series has been renewed for a fourth season, scheduled to premiere summer 2011.

Set and produced in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Breaking Bad is the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with advanced lung cancer at the beginning of the series. He turns to a life of crime, producing and selling methamphetamine with his former student and partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) in a desire to secure his family's financial future.

Breaking Bad has received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its writing and cinematography as well as for Cranston's and Paul's performances. It has won six Emmy Awardsâ€”including three consecutive wins for Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Cranstonâ€”in addition to numerous other awards and nominations.

The series is set and filmed in and around Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The network originally ordered nine episodes for the first season (including the pilot), but the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike limited the production to seven episodes.

Lead actor Bryan Cranston stated in an interview: "The term "breaking bad" is a southern colloquialism and it means when someone who has taken a turn off the path of the straight and narrow, when they've gone wrong. And that could be for that day or for a lifetime." Writer and creator Vince Gilligan defines the term as "to raise hell".

Breaking Bad reportedly costs $3 million per episode to produce, higher than average cost for a basic cable program.

Enjoy.
