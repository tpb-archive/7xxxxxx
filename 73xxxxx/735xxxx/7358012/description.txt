"So you have a man crush?"

"There's no such thing as a man crush!" Marshall said with a chuckle.

"So you just have a crush?"

"Let's just say that I am so excited for this film," he replied. "I've been waiting for it to happen since we met!"

When he said "we" he was talking about himself and Brice. They actually met several months ago. They had both been visiting at the same time for their first videos.

"We met at the hotel," Brice said. "I knew he was here for you guys."

"So it was love at first sight?" I asked.

"Yes!" Brice said. "He's so fucking gorgeous. I started talking to him and we exchanged numbers. We've been texting ever since."

I knew that Brice was excited about this. He had been asking for a while about when it was going to happen. It was obvious that he couldn't wait to get Marshall's thick cock inside him!

"It feels so good!" Brice moaned as Marshall fucked him. He looked up at us and said, "When he rams his big dick in all the way..." But Marshall didn't even give him a chance to finish his sentence! Brice was biting the pillow instead!

One thing I discovered was that both of them like it rough. On more than one occasion, Brice asked (actually, told) Marshall to put his hands around his neck.

"I love it!" Brice said. "If I'm with someone and he grabs my throat... I'm like, fuck me already!"
