Welcome to Go Go Crazy: a contest where talent and ambition take a backseat to speedos and desperation. Five shameless contestants with little to gain and nothing to lose take to the stage in a gay nightclub for a chance to achieve go go boy glory and a $1000 cash prize. On the judging panel are a burned out porn star, a Celine Dion "embodier," and the raunchy nightclub owner - all of whom threaten to steal the spotlight from the fame-hungry, back-stabbing contestants. Starring iconic drag comedian Hedda Lettuce, gay adult film star Jake Steel, and some sexy broadway actors, Go Go Crazy is a hilarious, outrageous mockumentary from director Fred M. Caruso (The Big Gay Musical). With a little sex, sabotage, and dirty tricks, this movie will turn you on, bend you over with laughter, and then give you a happy ending.
