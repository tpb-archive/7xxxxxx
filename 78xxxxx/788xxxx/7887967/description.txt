A fond farewell to the many inanimate objects, cultural icons and general stuff around us that find themselves on the verge of extinction.
WeΓÇÖve all heard of the list of endangered animals, but no one has ever pulled together a list of endangered inanimate objects.
Until now, that is.

Steve Stack has catalogued well over one hundred objects, traditions, cultural icons and, well, other stuff that is at risk of extinction.
Some of them have vanished already.
Cassette tapes, rotary dial phones, half-day closing, milk bottle deliveries, Concorde, handwritten letters, typewriters, countries that no longer exist, white dog pooΓÇª

ΓÇªall these and many more are big a fond farewell in this nostalgic, and sometimes irreverent, trip down memory lane.
