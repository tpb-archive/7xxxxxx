Book Description

With the iOS 6 software and the new iPhone 5, Apple has two world-class hits on its hands.

The important stuff you need to know:

The iPhone 5. This book unearths all the secrets of the newest iPhone. Taller screen, faster chip, 4G LTE Internet, thinner than ever.
The iOS 6 software. Older iPhones gain Do Not Disturb, the new Maps app, shared Photo Streams, camera panoramas, smarter Siri, and about 197 more new features. ItΓÇÖs all here.
The apps. That catalog of 750,000 add-on programs makes the iPhoneΓÇÖs phone features almost secondary. Now youΓÇÖll know how to find, manage, and exploit those apps.

The iPhone may be the worldΓÇÖs coolest computer, but itΓÇÖs still a computer, with all of a computerΓÇÖs complexities. iPhone: The Missing Manual is a funny, gorgeously illustrated guide to the tips, shortcuts, and workarounds that will turn you, too, into an iPhone addict.
