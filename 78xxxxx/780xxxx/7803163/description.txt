These are the Marvel comics I got from the week beginning 10/31/2012.  These are not a complete list of what Marvel put out this week.  There are other torrents for that. There are 9 titles in this week's offering. All comics are either in CBR or CBZ format and are labeled individually.  Please do not share my descriptions or torrent ads with anyone without messaging me first.  If this torrent has no seeds please msg me privately.  I will be glad to reup anything that has no seeds.  I sincerely ask that if you like what you get, please purchase them in some way.  We cannot do what we do if there is nothing being made to scan and upload.

Starting with the first week of November, I will be releasing a new pack with only the Marvel Now comics.  I will still carry this torrent as well as my DC Universe 52, Zero Day, and Independent comics packs.  If you would like to help, please let me know.  

So one of the questions I have been getting is why not do a full release of Marvel Comics.  So I will leave the vote to everyone here.  Please leave in the comment section whether New Marvel I Like should go away and a Total Marvel torrent should replace it.  I am curious what people think.
