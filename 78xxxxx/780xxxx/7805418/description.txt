McLaren launches "Tooned" animation series, featuring Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button

(McLaren) We've created our very own McLaren animation series!!

'Tooned' is our new CGI-animated series which features our very own Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, who voiced their own characters, as well as the acclaimed British actor and comedian Alexander Armstrong.

McLaren group chairman Ron Dennis said that Tooned is the result of extensive market research carried out by McLaren, which John [Allert], our Group Brand Director, and I then analysed carefully together. It's an exciting and creative concept that addresses the insights gleaned from our research in a very innovative way, adding that the animations would create a more demographically accessible face for McLaren.
