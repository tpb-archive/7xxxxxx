MIA (Ruth Vega Fernandez) and FRIDA (Liv Mjnes), both in their
thirties, meet each other for the first time at their parents'
engagement party. Mia's father, Lasse (Krister Henriksson), is about
to get married to Frida's mother, Elizabeth (Lena Endre), which will
make Mia and Frida stepsisters. Lasse's daughter, Mia, has not
visited her father in years and arrives with her boyfriend, Tim
(Joakim Ntterqvist), with whom she is about to get married. As Mia
and Frida get to know one another, strong emotions begin to stir
between them. Their relationship will turn everything upside down for
everyone close to them with dramatic consequences.
