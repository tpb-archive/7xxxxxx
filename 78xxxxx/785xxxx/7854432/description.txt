In most games you see stars in the background, you shoot asteroids or
you live on planets. But in Solar 2 you ARE these objects! Enter a
universe where you must prove yourself to the resident god-like figure
by doing its many bizarre and varied tasks. Or just ignore it and see
how big you can grow!

Solar 2 is an open-world, sandbox game set in an infinite abstract
universe. Play constructively: grow your system, nurture life on your
planets and attack enemy life in huge space battles. Play
destructively: crash into other objects and cause chaos, use your
orbiting objects like wrecking balls, steal planets from other systems.
Features:

Dynamic abstract sandbox universe. Changes and evolves as you do.

Non-linear missions and open-world gameplay.

No boundaries. Drift forever in ambient space bliss.

Full of weird eccentric humor and stuff.

Extensive custom sound track.
