A grieving family whose daughter was killed in a car crash with a drunken driver is outraged and frustrated as they encounter the inevitable bureaucratic delays in bringing the case to trial.

When the judge is forced to rule time and again in favor of the defense, it appears that the driver might escape punishment altogether.
