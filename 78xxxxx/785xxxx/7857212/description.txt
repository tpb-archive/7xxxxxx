The only game that gives players the ability to be in real world events, Medal of Honor Warfighter lets you experience the action as it might have taken place in the field.
The new Medal of Honor Warfighter game is inspired by and has been developed with Tier 1 Operators from an elite, international community. This personal story was written by actual Tier 1 Operators while deployed overseas. In it, players step into the boots of these warfighters and apply unique skill sets to track down a real global threat, in real international locations, sponsored by real enemies. It doesn't get any more authentic than Medal of Honor Warfighter.
