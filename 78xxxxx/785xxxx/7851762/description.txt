RAMDisk creates a virtual RAM drive, or block of memory, which your computer treats as if it were a disk drive. By storing files and programs into memory, you can speed up internet load times and disk-to-disk activities, accelerate databases and reduce compile times.
For registration of the program, read the .txt file.

Program is tested with WinXP SP3 and Win7 Ultimate.

Just have FUN.
