Far Cry 3 returns the series to a tropical island setting, similar to       
the first game and unlike the second game, which took place in an           
African savanna setting. Players will assume the role of protagonist        
Jason Brody, a tourist who has been stranded on an island chain in the      
grips of violent local conflict for years. 
  
Jason has been separated from his girlfriend and, in his search for her, 
he will have to deal with a wide cast of mostly unstable characters who 
have been on these islands for some time..
