About the Game
Settle-Carlisle Specials puts you in the cab of fabulous preserved steam locomotives as they haul trains full of rail fans along the scenic Settle-Carlisle line. Interest in steam specials has grown since before the final phasing out of British steam on the main line, when enthusiasts would flock to ride on specials ΓÇô sometimes little more than a few old brake vans behind a steam loco ΓÇô to enjoy a steam-hauled journey before diesel and electric took over for good. This practice continues today, as privately-owned steam locomotives are granted permission to run special services on the main line to the delight of passengers and onlookers alike.

With four preserved steam locomotives to drive, you can run rail tours along the wonderful Settle-Carlisle line whenever you wish. Settle-Carlisle Specials includes the famous A1 Tornado in British Railways Brusnwick Green, V2 Green Arrow, GWR Wootton Hall and GWR King Edward II in blue. There is also a Class 47 in maroon livery acting as a banker, typical of steam specials.
