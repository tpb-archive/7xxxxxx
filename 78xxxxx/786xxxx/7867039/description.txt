Plot:
Steins;Gate is set in the summer of 2010, approximately one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head,[7] in Akihabara. Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game.[8] According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things.
