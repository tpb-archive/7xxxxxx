Porky Pig is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and
Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. He was the first character created by the studio
to draw audiences based on his star power, and the animators (particularly Bob Clampett)
created many critically acclaimed shorts using the fat little pig. Even after he was
supplanted by later characters, Porky continued to be popular with moviegoers and,
more importantly, the Warners directors, who recast him in numerous everyman and
sidekick roles. He is known for his signature line at the end of each short,
'Th-th-th-that's all folks!' The slogan had also been used by both Bosko and Buddy
and even Beans at the end of every Looney Tunes cartoon. In contrast, the Merrie Melodies
series used the slogan: So Long, Folks! until the late 1930s when it was replaced with
the same one used on the Looney Tunes series.
(When Bugs Bunny was the closing character, he would break the pattern by simply saying,
in his Brooklynese accent, 'And Dat's De End!'). He is the oldest continuing Looney
Tunes character.
