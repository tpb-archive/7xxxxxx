This is my 153rd official H264 AVCHD 720p release. Enjoy the 8th episode of WWE Main Event HDTV in 720p WWE wrestling fans. 

This release is in H264 AVCHD MP4 format with AAC 2 channel stereo audio. This release is playable with Sony Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones, iPhone, iPad, VLC player as well as Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, and any other devices capable of playing 720p HD MP4 video files with AAC 2 channel stereo audio.

If you want this show in MKV format it is easy to convert it from MP4 to MKV using MKVtoolnix 2.2.0 (MKVmerge 2.2.0) which you can download from here:  http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/win32/mkvtoolnix-2.2.0-setup.exe

Here's how to do it:  Download and install MKVMerge (Use link above). It is a free program that allows you to take video and audio files and convert them into MKV files on the fly, making it a very quick conversion.

Open MKVMerge on your computer, and you will be greeted by its home menu. Click the "Add" button that is near the top of the program, and a new window will appear giving you access to your computer's files. Locate your MP4 video files and select them. Press "Open," and it will load into MKVMerge.

Press the "Browse" button at the bottom of the program, and a window will appear. Locate a place on your computer to save the new MKV file after it is created. Once you have found a place, click "Save" to save the location. Click the "Start Muxing" button at the bottom of the program and your MKV file will be created. Depending on the size of the file, it could take a few minutes. Once it is finished locate the MKV file after the program congratulates you on the conversion and play it as you would any other video file.

To ensure that you can get proper MKV playback after the mkv conversion be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below:

Once installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:

Media Player Classic or Windows Media Player. 

VLC player doesn't play the MKV video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and LG BP-620 3D BluRay player does.
 
Enjoy the WWE Main Event 9th episode WWE wrestling fans and thanks for downloading my WWE Main Event HDTV 2012-11-28 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH release.
