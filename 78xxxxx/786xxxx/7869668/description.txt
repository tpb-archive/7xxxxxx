Overview:

In RaymanΓÇÖs world, nature and people live together in peace. One day, the evil Mr. Dark defeats Betilla, the Fairy, and steals the Great Protoon, the provider of harmony and balance. The Electoons who used to gravitate towards it lose their natural stability and scatter all over the world. Strange phenomena begin to occur: freaks and hostile characters appear, capturing every Electoon they can find! The disappearance of the Great Protoon also neutralized all of BetillaΓÇÖs powers, and she needs time to regenerate before she can help in any way. They definitely need a hero to save them, and it looks like youΓÇÖre it. ItΓÇÖs now up to Rayman and you to rescue the world.
