132 pages! From the co-creators of Gotham Central and FATALE comes a lost crime noir masterpiece. SCENE OF THE CRIME was the first time ED BRUBAKER and MICHAEL LARK worked together before their acclaimed runs on Daredevil and Gotham Central and it was inked by SEAN PHILLIPS. This is where it all began, with a hard-hitting mystery story, a modern day 'Chinatown' that garnered nominations for Best Miniseries and Best Writer in the 2000 Eisner Awards. Also included in this new collection are behind the scenes art and stories, a new foreword by BRUBAKER, and many other extras.
