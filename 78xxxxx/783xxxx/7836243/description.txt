A mysterious girl, Heather, washes up on the shores of Berk. Proving herself
a valuable addition to Berk, she wins the affection of everyone except Astrid,
who notices Heather is particularly interested in flying dragons and in the
Book of Dragons. Hiccup refuses to believe she could be lying about anything,
but when Heather disappears on Stormfly, headed for Outcast Island, Hiccup and
the village realize they were duped.
