Your fodd, your medicine, your health care has all been Doctored


ΓÇ£Your back pain will require SURGERYΓÇ¥
ΓÇ£Without these pills, you face life-long PAINΓÇ¥
ΓÇ£Your childΓÇÖs behavior requires MEDICATIONΓÇ¥

ThatΓÇÖs what the doctor tells you, but who tells the doctor what to say?

A visit to the doctor can be traumatic enough. Now we learn about the ΓÇ£influencersΓÇ¥ ΓÇô the people you never see, but whose job it is to turn you into a compliant, pill popping, revenue generation unit. And at all costs.

Doctored reveals the unseen tactics of these ΓÇ£influencersΓÇ¥ in an investigation that leads to the highest levels of the American Medical Association (AMA) and reveals an alarming portrait of deception and criminality. Along the way we wonder:

Is much of what we ΓÇ£knowΓÇ¥ about modern medicine just slick marketing from companies that profit when weΓÇÖre in pain (or by putting us in pain)?
Why arenΓÇÖt we being told about the successes of natural therapies?
Why do so many people think chiropractors are ΓÇ£quacks,ΓÇ¥ nutritional supplements a waste of money, and acupuncture a fringe therapy?
Is it because the ΓÇ£Medical MonopolyΓÇ¥ spends millions a year attacking, ridiculing, and trying to discredit these natural therapies? The answers are almost beyond belief, until Doctored takes us into the courtroom with five chiropractors who, having been labeled ΓÇ£an unscientific cult,ΓÇÖ fought back and won a landmark verdict.
