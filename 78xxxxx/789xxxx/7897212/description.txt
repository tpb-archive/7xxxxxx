Book Description

With Async JavaScript, youΓÇÖll develop a deeper understanding of the JavaScript language. YouΓÇÖll start with a ground-up primer on the JavaScript event modelΓÇökey to avoiding many of the most common mistakes JavaScripters make. From there youΓÇÖll see tools and design patterns for turning that conceptual understanding into practical code.

The concepts in the book are illustrated with runnable examples drawn from both the browser and the Node.js server framework, incorporating complementary libraries including jQuery, Backbone.js, and Async.js. YouΓÇÖll learn how to create dynamic web pages and highly concurrent servers by mastering the art of distributing events to where they need to be handled, rather than nesting callbacks within callbacks within callbacks.

Async JavaScript will get you up and running with real web development quickly. By the time youΓÇÖve finished the Promises chapter, youΓÇÖll be parallelizing Ajax requests or running animations in sequence. By the end of the book, youΓÇÖll even know how to leverage Web Workers and AMD for JavaScript applications with cutting-edge performance. Most importantly, youΓÇÖll have the knowledge you need to write async code with confidence.

What you need
Basic knowledge of JavaScript is recommended. If you feel that youΓÇÖre not up to speed, see the ΓÇ£Resources for Learning JavaScriptΓÇ¥ section in the preface.
