With nine-million monthly players, World of Warcraft is the most popular MMORPG on the planet, and with the release of the latest expansion, Mists of Pandaria, its popularity will soar once more. As with previous expansions, Mists of Pandaria ups the ante, improves existing gameplay systems, doles out a ton of new content, and implements numerous new features that will have players old and new hooked for months, if not years.

Raising the level cap to 90, World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria drags veterans back into the game, offering a range of new, addictive challenges, on top of the many new quests and raids. This new content is located in the lost Kingdom of Pandaria, home to the game?COs first neutral race, the Pandaren. And as the name suggests, the Pandaren are walking, talking Pandas. Yes, actual Pandas.

Another major addition is The Monk, an all-new, multi-talented class capable of adapting to any role. Monks are masters of bare-handed combat, choosing to draw their weapons only for devastating finishing moves. Monk healers bring harmony and balance to every group, healing even the most grievous of injuries with ancient remedies and focused spiritual arts. And few can hope to out-last the unquenchable prowess of the Monk Brewmaster, whose empowering beverages and unpredictable combat style allow them to absorb incredible amounts of punishment.

Other additions include pet battles, turning previously passive cosmetic items into lethal killing machines; challenge modes, which add a competitive element to otherwise-ordinary activities; Scenarios, co-operative, highly challenging events; and a new and improved Talent system, to name but a few.

As with previous World of Warcraft releases, Mists of Pandaria includes full support for NVIDIA Surround, 3D Vision, 3D Surround, and SLI, enabling NVIDIA GPU users to get the absolute max from their hardware, whether that be in 2D, or stereoscopic 3D.
