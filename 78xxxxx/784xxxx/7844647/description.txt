Did you know that the most creative companies have centralized bathrooms? That brainstorming meetings are a terrible idea? That the color blue can help you double your creative output?

From the New York Times best-selling author of How We Decide comes a sparkling and revelatory look at the new science of creativity. Shattering the myth of muses, higher powers, even creative ΓÇ£types,ΓÇ¥ Jonah Lehrer demonstrates that creativity is not a single gift possessed by the lucky few. ItΓÇÖs a variety of distinct thought processes that we can all learn to use more effectively.

Lehrer reveals the importance of embracing the rut, thinking like a child, daydreaming productively, and adopting an outsiderΓÇÖs perspective (travel helps). He unveils the optimal mix of old and new partners in any creative collaboration, and explains why criticism is essential to the process. Then he zooms out to show how we can make our neighborhoods more vibrant, our companies more productive, and our schools more effective.

YouΓÇÖll learn about Bob DylanΓÇÖs writing habits and the drug addictions of poets. YouΓÇÖll meet a Manhattan bartender who thinks like a chemist, and an autistic surfer who invented an entirely new surfing move. YouΓÇÖll see why Elizabethan England experienced a creative explosion, and how PixarΓÇÖs office space is designed to spark the next big leap in animation.

Collapsing the layers separating the neuron from the finished symphony, Imagine reveals the deep inventiveness of the human mind, and its essential role in our increasingly complex world.
