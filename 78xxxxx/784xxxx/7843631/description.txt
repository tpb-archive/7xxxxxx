X-Plane 9

A very cool game/simulation software for various types of aircraft, civil and military. The lot of DVDs contain the terrain and sceneries, which cover almost every bit of the planet.

This is the fifth DVD from a total of six. Size 7.2G tested to work using Alcohol-120% in WinXP. It also works for linux, you will need to go to "http://wiki.x-plane.com/DVD_Installers" and get the linux installer to use with these DVD.

I can not seed for all the DVDs at the same time. I will start with this one first, allow it some time to spread and then move on to the next DVD. Hopefully there will be others able to upload.

There is no viruses in this whatsoever. All operations have been made using Linux and the test was on another machine with WinXP and also on yet another machine with Win7. In both it worked flawlessly.

NOTE:
Early downloaders, please seed! Give just like you take, contribute with what you can. Every bit counts. And if you like this software after you try it's not a shame to buy it. I did.
