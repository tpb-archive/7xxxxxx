 Installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP with David Gassner describes how to install and configure Apache HTTP server, MySQL database server, and PHP, known as the AMP stack, on a local development computer. Chapters are devoted to multiple installation approaches: installing the components separately on both Windows and Mac (including coverage of Apache and PHP on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion), installing the pre-packaged Apache and MySQL distributions in WampServer on Windows and MAMP on Mac, and installing the cross-platform XAMPP and Bitnami on both Mac and Windows. Exercise files are included with the course.
