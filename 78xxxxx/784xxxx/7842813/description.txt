what to do with. An essential download for anyone studying and reading across 
the spectrum of leftwing thought, for historians, political scientists, the 
curious, researchers, those searching for enlightenment, completists, and 
anyone who wants to helps make sure this unique collection is shared widely 
and made available to all.

marxists.org allows public rsync to copy and mirror all their material. This 
is a direct copy of the whole site, from which we removed all the folders for
languages other than English. This includes the html files from the website
as well as some things like the CSS files. We zipped the entire tree as 
otherwise the .torrent file would become too large. The whole file listing is
also included as filelist.txt

You can browse the site online, there are several interesting pages including 
a listing describing many of the authors. They also have a page pointing out
which writers they consider to be central to Marxism. Or you can make a local
mirror and follow the links there. 

We will make a torrent of the whole archive including all the other languages
if people want us to do so (or the individual folder for a single language).
