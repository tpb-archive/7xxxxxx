About the Game
The 4CIG is a classic slam door electric multiple unit and is now available in Southern livery with scenarios for the London to Brighton Expansion Pack. Introduced in 1964, the Class 421 4CIG (4-car Corridor Brighton stock) ran as a 4-car train comprising a driving trailer, motor coach, unpowered trailer coach and finally a driving trailer. It is a classic example of the slam door EMUs which were once such a familiar sight across the rail networks of southern England. Extensive 3rd-rail electrification of the Southern Region led to the widespread adoption of these 90mph EMUs, and the 4CIG (British Rail Class 421) was initially introduced on the London-Brighton Line where its multiple doors enabled rapid turnaround of passengers at the many regular station stops . The 4CIG units received a facelift in the late 1980s, and continued in mainline passenger service into the 21st Century!
