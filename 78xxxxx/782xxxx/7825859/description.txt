A new kind of alien invasionΓÇª

When Quentin Draith wakes up in a private sanatorium, he has no memory of who he is or how he received the injuries riddling his body.

It seems he is one of a special breed, a person with unusual powers. HeΓÇÖs also the prime suspect in a string of murders linked by a series of seemingly mundane objects. The deeper he digs and the harder he works to clear his name, the more Quentin realizes that some truths are better off staying buriedΓÇª
