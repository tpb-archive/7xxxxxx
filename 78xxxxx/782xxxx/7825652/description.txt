A stranger has kidnapped Sue's daughter, Lily. But he doesn't want her money, only her suffering - and he will kill Lily if Sue doesn't follow his every command. With detailed instructions, the faceless abductor leads Sue into a blinding snowstorm on the longest night of the year to a place she has not traveled to since childhood. The voice on the other end of her cell phone somehow knows Sue's deepest, most chilling secret - an ominous incident from her past, buried long ago... Chasing the Dead is a fast-paced, ferociously tense supernatural thriller from the twisted mind of Star Wars horror novelist Joe Schreiber (Red Harvest, Death Troopers).
