Book description:

Josh and Emma are about to discover themselves--fifteen years in the future

It''s 1996, and Josh and Emma have been neighbors their whole lives. They''ve been best friends almost as long--at least, up until last November, when everything changed. Things have been awkward ever since, but when Josh''s family gets a free AOL CD-ROM in the mail, his mom makes him bring it over so that Emma can install it on her new computer. When they sign on, they''re automatically logged onto Facebook . . . but Facebook hasn''t been invented yet. Josh and Emma are looking at themselves fifteen years in the future.

Their spouses, careers, homes, and status updates--it''s all there. And every time they refresh their pages, their futures change. As they grapple with the ups and downs of what their lives hold, they''re forced to confront what they''re doing right--and wrong--in the present.
