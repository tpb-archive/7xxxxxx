PaperPort Professional 14 Desktop Enhancements

In addition, PaperPort 14 also delivers many significant new desktop enhancements, including:
PaperPort Anywhere Sync Connector: The connection from the PaperPort desktop to the PaperPort Anywhere service is achieved by way of the PaperPort Anywhere Sync Connector. This Windows system tray application provides the capability for you to sign-in to the PaperPort Anywhere service from the PaperPort desktop, monitor storage usage, and control which folders you want synchronized across the cloud and mobile applications.
The Nuance Cloud Connector application: Now you can gain access to a number of cloud services, including Microsoft Live SkyDrive, Google Docs, Box.net, and many more. Plus, files are accessed in the PaperPort folder directory, so you can scan, stack, or unstack PDF files, and create PDF files directly in the cloud.
Evernote Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´Send ToÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ Connector: Drag-and-drop files to the Evernote Send To Connector, create a new note or add the document to an existing note. You can also right click on the Evernote connector and get files attached to any note so they are copied to the PaperPort desktop.
Enhanced network folder support: PaperPort 14 now takes advantage of fast, reliable thumbnail viewing of documents stored on shared network folders. Additionally, PaperPort 14 locks files in use over the network to prevent problems that may occur when more than one person tries to view or modify the same file.
Windows file and folder options: In PaperPort 14, the Windows Context menu is supported by right-clicking on any file, so you can access Windows or other software and perform key tasks, including compressing and uncompressing ZIP files.
Scanning improvements: WeÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³ve enhanced PaperPortÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s scanning capabilities in PaperPort 14, so scanned color documents using PDF-MRC compression are now 62% smaller. Other time saving highlights include scan and open a document with one press of a button, create and save default custom file names, and create PDF/A directly from your scanner.
New workspace options for greater productivity: With PaperPort 14, thereÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s no need to remember where you put a recently scanned or opened file. New buttons have been added for Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´recently scannedÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ and Î“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¼Ã´recently openedÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â”¬Â¥ documents, so you can quickly jump back to a folder that contains a recently scanned or opened document.
Folder notes improvements: Now you can right click on any folder in the folder directory and get an option to add notes directly to that particular folder. This enhancement is useful for applying information to PDF documents that are common to all files in a particular file, such as contact information (e.g., name, address, telephone number); project or customer IDs; or numbers, reminders, document descriptions, and more.
Improved desktop thumbnails for PDF: In PaperPort 14 the PDF document thumbnails offer more information about PDF documents to save you time and focus on more important tasks. A large information icon now appears in the upper left-hand corner of PDF document thumbnails, indicating the file contains keywords and descriptive text. Hover over the icon, and it will display the information so you donÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³t have to open the file.
