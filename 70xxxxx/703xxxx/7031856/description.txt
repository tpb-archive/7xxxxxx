Nitro pro 7: PDF made easy
Nitro Pro lets you quickly create, convert, combine, edit, sign, and share 100% industry-standard PDF files for superior results and savings. Nitroâ€™s easy-to-use PDF tools make working with digital documents pain free.

Features
Nitro Pro 7 gives you a powerful set of easy-to-use tools that make working with digital documents simple, straightforward, and more cost-effective.

* View, create and combine PDF files
- Open, read and edit PDF files from other PDF applications, like AdobeÂ® AcrobatÂ® and Adobe ReaderÂ®.
- Preview PDF files in folders and Microsoft Outlook, without opening Nitro Pro.
- Open PDF files in Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Firefox.
- Display PDF files as thumbnail document previews, instead of static PDF file icons.
- Create PDF and PDF/A documents from almost any kind of file.
- Convert and combine files into a single PDF document.
- Convert entire collections of files to PDF in one batch.
- One-button PDF creation from MicrosoftÂ® Word, ExcelÂ®, and PowerPointÂ®.
- Convert Microsoft Word files into professional PDF files that include bookmarks, links, metadata and security.

* Scan and OCR PDF files
- Scan paper documents to PDF.
- Convert paper- and image-based files into searchable and editable PDF files using optical character recognition (OCR) technology.

what's new in version 7
- Paragraph Text Editing. Edit text right in the copy of the paragraph, without converting to MicrosoftÂ® WordÂ® or a text editor â€” just like you would in a word processing application. Edit words and lines of text within paragraphs, reformat, realign, reflow, and adjust text attributes without leaving your PDF document.
- Signature Profiles. Create profiles for rapid application of your digital signature. This is a huge timesaver when having to sign the same PDF multiple times.
- Stamp Signature. Digitally apply or â€œstampâ€ your signature to a page so it looks as natural as pen and paper. Itâ€™s as simple as the click of a button.
- Integrated, High-Performance Renderer. An enhanced renderer delivers greater performance and increased quality. Enjoy crisper text, more accurate and faster rendering of vector art and CAD drawings, more responsive editing, zooming, scrolling, and more.
- Redaction. Now you can search for, identify, and permanently remove sensitive or private text and images from documents.
