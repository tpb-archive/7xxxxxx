Ragnarok Online kRO Client.

Usage Instruction:
    These downloads contain content of a ready to play RO folder. There is no installation needed.
    
    1) If you don\\\\\\\'t know what you are doing or you do not have an RO Client installed. You should download all 12 files: data.grf parts 1-7, rdata.grf, the BGM pack, the DLL pack and the two replacement patchers.

    2) After you got all the files, put them in one folder and extract all the .rar files (normally at C:\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\Gravity\\\\\\\\RO\\\\\\\\). They should all be at the same level, see screenshot for example:. When extracting the dll package, if you get errors, try extracting it with 7zip.

    3) Then extract the two replacement patchers in the .zip files (rsu-kro-rag-lite.exe and rsu-kro-renewal-lite.exe by Ai4rei) to the same folder. Run the two exe to patch your kRO and kRO Renewal data. You will need to run these two patchers regularly to keep your client files up to date. Especially when you get sprite erorr or crashes during game-play.

    4) Now you can install the client from the server you are going to play and then start playing.
