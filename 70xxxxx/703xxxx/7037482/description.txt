GAME NOTES:

The unthinkable happens in 2016. A nuclear exchange in the
Middle East kills 20 million people and cripples the
world's oil supply. Crude oil prices spike at $800 a
barrel.

One year later, the threat of world-wide nuclear war is
eliminated when the United States and Europe deploy a
comprehensive space-based anti-ballistic missile shield.
Russia soon follows with an advanced missile defense
system of its own. Intercontinental ballistic missiles are
rendered obsolete.

Russia becomes the world's primary supplier of energy and
experiences a massive economic boom. With its newfound
riches, Russia quickly re-establishes itself as a major
superpower and restores her military might.

Western Europe, with the notable exception of the UK and
Ireland, unifies to create the European Federation. This
new nation is destined to be a formidable 21st-century
Superpower.

In 2020, the United States is on the verge of finishing
construction on the Freedom Star, a controversial orbital
military platform that will upset the balance of world
power. The European Federation withdraws from NATO in
protest.

Tensions between the European Federation, the United
States, and Russia are building and will soon reach the
breaking point.

The EndWar is about to begin.
