Discover how to perform any routine action in one click!


Stop typing the same text over and over again! Now you don't need to go through numerous menus to find the necessary program or web page. With this new automation tool you can configure hotkeys for quick execution of all your actions - just like real pro's do. With Comfort Keys, you considerably decrease the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) risk caused by frequently pressing mouse buttons and moving hands from the mouse to the keyboard and back. Shortcut keys configured in the program work in all MicrosoftÂ® Windows applications. While specifying shortcut keys, you can use any keys including NumLock and CapsLock.

The built-in on-screen keyboard will help you to select a comfortable keyboard combination and afterwards this on-screen keyboard will show you what shortcut keys are available for you. It is easy to use Comfort Keys in workgroups. To do it, just save the shortcut file to a network resource and configure it to be used on every workstation. It is completely compatible with MicrosoftÂ® Windows Vista, XP and 2000.

Comfort Keys will help you to:
- Launch the necessary programs and open web pages by pressing a single hotkey.
- Insert predefined texts (email templates, signatures, passwords, greetings, phone numbers, addresses, etc.) using hotkeys or the built-in template manager.
- Change the language and case of the typed text.
- Control the sound volume in a quick and convenient manner.
- Record key press sequences (macros) and play them back as many times as you need.
- Block some keys or simulate the press of a specific key when another one is pressed.
- And much more...
