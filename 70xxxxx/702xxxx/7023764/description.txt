SUPPORTING WINDOWS 7 is written for those entering the field of PC repair or those who are currently practicing as support technicians. This Windows 7 supplement is designed to be used in conjunction with A+ GUIDE TO MANAGING AND MAINTAINING YOUR PC, 7TH EDITION or A+ GUIDE TO SOFTWARE, 5TH EDITION. This text covers the differences between Windows 7 and Vista and how to install and maintain Windows 7, including the improved Windows Back up utility, the Action Center, the system image, and tools for troubleshooting network connections. Coverage also includes Windows 7 security tools and techniques and how to troubleshoot Windows 7 start up errors and slowdowns. Each chapter ends with labs that focus on the support tools and techniques in Windows 7 that differ from Vista, and the Windows 7 content is mapped to CompTIA's 2009 A+ exam objectives. After completion of this text and the Windows content in either of the core books, the reader will be equipped to support all of the current Windows operating systems including Windows 7, Vista and XP.
