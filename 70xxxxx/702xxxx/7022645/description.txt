Diego 'El Cigala' delivers another hit album with Cigala & Tango. After the success of his work Lagrimas Negras, where 'El Cigala' took on different classic Latin music songs alongside Cuban pianist Bebo Valdes, the Spanish singer has showed us again his talent to mix Flamenco with Latin music genres.

This time, Diego 'El Cigala' combined Flamenco with Tango in 11 outstanding tracks recorded live at the Gran Rex in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The following is the review of Cigala & Tango, an album nominated to the 2011 Latin Grammy Awards in the category of Best Tango Album.
The Recording

In order to fully appreciate Cigala & Tango, it is important to know the challenges that were involved in this production. First of all, the album was recorded in one single piece without pauses or without taking care of technical details. In other words, 'El Cigala' and the musicians on stage needed to be almost perfect. Second, the Spanish singer went to Argentina to sing Tango in front of a demanding crowd made of Tango enthusiasts. In fact, 'El Cigala' was quite nervous before the show but the tension went away right in the middle of the first track of the CD ("Garganta Con Arena") when the crowd delivered the first of many applauses that night at the Gran Rex.

First Tracks

Cigala & Tango starts with the song "Garganta con Arena," one of the most beautiful tracks in the entire CD. The guitar intro, which sets the Flamenco air included in the whole album, is followed by the singing of the Spanish artist. Once he stops, the piano takes the melody and the crowd goes crazy. This is the point when you realize you are in front of something truly special.

After "Garganta con Arena," Diego 'El Cigala' comes with another strong performance in the song "Las Cuarenta". This track, which the legendary Cuban singer Rolando Laserie made famous throughout Latin America, is one of the songs in the album that gives you goose bumps. Because of the piano playing, "Las Cuarenta" brings some memories of the stuff Diego 'El Cigala' produced in Lagrimas Negras.

Carlos Cardel and Andres Calamaro

Before recording this album, Diego 'El Cigala' went through lots of classic Tango songs. He picked the ones that fit his voice and style. One of them was "El Dia Que Me Quieras" by Carlos Gardel. This is the third track of the album, a fantastic song that combines Tango, Flamenco and Bolero, all in one. This is as good as it gets in Cigala & Tango.

Besides the talented musicians that played alongside Diego 'El Cigala' in the production of Cigala & Tango, Latin Rock legend Andres Calamaro also shared the stage with the Flamenco artist. Together they sing the Milonga single "Los Hermanos," another outstanding track full of that common intensity that unites Flamenco and Tango music.
Moving Between Flamenco and Tango

On this album, Diego 'El Cigala' moves constantly between Flamenco and Tango music. While songs like "Garganta Con Arena" and "Nostalgias" are heavily influenced by Flamenco sounds, tracks like "Tomo Y Obligo," "Sus Ojos Se Cerraron" and "En Esta Tarde Gris" are defined by a heavier Tango style.

I believe Diego 'El Cigala' is more successful in this CD when he faces pure Tango songs. After all, he is not trying to sound like a Tango singer but as a Flamenco artist who sings Tango without renouncing to his own style. The final applause from the crowd, after the Zamba single "Alfonsina Y El Mar," gives you an idea of how much the land of Tango liked what Diego 'El Cigala' did with Tango.

'Cigala & Tango' - Bottom Line

Cigala & Tango is a wonderful album. Diego 'El Cigala' has found the bridge that connects Tango and Flamenco music. Besides the talent of the Spanish singer, this album is a treat in term of music thanks to the amazing assembly of artists that took part on this project. Cigala & Tango is one of the best Latin music albums of 2011. Five stars to this work!
