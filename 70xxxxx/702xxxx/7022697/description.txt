                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Casualty is the world's longest running and most successful medical drama     
 series on television. It depicts the private and working lives of the         
 patients, doctors, nurses and all others attending a small but frantically    
 busy accident and emergency department of the large Holby General hospital. By
 mixing episodic plots with longer, character-based stories it ensures that we 
 get to know the characters as people with lives, not just doctors or nurses.  
 With consistently superb storylines and great acting, Casualty is compulsive  
 viewing.                                                                      
                                 Enjoy!
