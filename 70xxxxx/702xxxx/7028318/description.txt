Genesis is a 2004 documentary written and directed by Claude 

Nuridsany and Marie PÃ©rennou that explores the origins of earth and 

its inhabitants. The film focuses on the life of many animals. It is 

narrated by Sotigui KouyatÃ©.
The film credits also list the natural events, animals and their 

situations as part of the "cast list."


Just like the director did some ago in Microcosmos, this is a 

project in which we can see the advances of film-making, the one 

that can show us images that we had never seen before.
From the crystallization of Vitamin C through and electronic 

microscope, to the sea horses love dance, from the amazing life of 

the walking fish to the love parakeets, from the beautiful dance of 

Jellyfish to the lava rivers, every single image is filled with 

color, life, joy and some kind of mystery.
Blending humor with seriousness innocence with wisdom an African 

griot uses the evocative language of myth and fable to relate the 

birth of the universe and the stars the fiery beginnings of our 

planet and the appearance of life on earth featuring animals as the 

main players.
Genesis is one of the most fascinating and relevant documentaries. 

It is an account of the beginning of everything, but focuses most 

especially on the nature of life on our planet.
The truths contained in this film and the fashion in which they are 

masterfully woven into a much broader, overall picture are 

compelling, the imagery is mesmerizing, and for anyone who is truly 

interested in the essence and mannerisms of life as we know it, this 

film is an excellent introduction to a fuller, more complete 

understanding.
