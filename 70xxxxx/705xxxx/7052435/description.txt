Smart Hide IP v2.6.6.8
Can Someone Find me with my IP Address?
Yes! In most cases all that can be easily determined is who your ISP is and possibly the state and city you reside in. Cybercriminals can use it to track back to your computer's specific IP address, which means they can secretly
read your emails and IM conversations,
watch your shopping habits,
detect personal information such as SSN, credit card passwords,
even others...
