Atomic Robo V6 #5 (of 5) - The Ghost of Station X
Written by Brian Clevinger
Art by Scott Wegener
Red 5 Comics

If you have never heard of Brian Clevinger and Scott Wegeners series before, it tells the tale of Robo, an automaton created around the turn of the century by Nikola Tesla. Each miniseries takes place in a different time period in Robos life, bouncing back and forth in time. Volume 6 takes place in modern times, and deals with Robo and his team of Action Scientists being asked by NASA to rescue the crew of an orbiting space station. Unfortunately, they may not have the time or equipment in order to make the rescue. These are the Action Scientists though, and no job is beyond
