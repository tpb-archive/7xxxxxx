                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Three best friends called Tim, Thom and Trevor are challenged by Hugh         
 Fearnley-Whittingstall with the adventure of a lifetime. The have five weeks  
 to travel from River Cottage in Axminster, Devon, to Lands' End in Cornwall,  
 without any funds. All they have to use to travel around in is a three-tonne, 
 1980s electric milk float with a top speed of 17mph. They have to look for    
 food and find renewable electricity for their milk float along the way.
       
                                 Enjoy!
