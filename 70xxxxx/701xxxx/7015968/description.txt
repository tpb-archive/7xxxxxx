5 times, resumes and schedules downloads. Comprehensive error recovery and resume 
capability will restart broken or interrupted downloads due to lost connections, 
network problems, computer shutdowns, or unexpected power outages. Simple graphic 
user interface makes IDM user friendly and easy to use. IDM has a smart download 
logic accelerator that features intelligent dynamic file segmentation and safe 
multipart downloading technology to accelerate your downloads. Unlike other 
download managers and accelerators, IDM segments downloaded files dynamically 
during download process and reuses available connections without additional 
connect and login stages to achieve best acceleration performance.

Main Features:
* Internet Download Manager supports all popular browsers including IE, AOL, MSN, 
  Opera, Firefox, Avant Browser, and it can be integrated into any Internet 
  application to take over downloads using unique Advanced Browser Integration
  feature.

  IDM will take over the download and accelerate it. IDM supports HTTP, FTP, HTTPS 
  and MMS protocols.
* Download Speed Acceleration. IDM can accelerate downloads by up to 5 times due 
  to its intelligent dynamic file segmentation technology.
* Download Resume. IDM will resume unfinished download from the place where they 
  left off.

  MySpaceTV, and Google Video.

  that are specified with filters from web sites, for example all pictures from
  a web site, or subsets of web sites, or complete web sites for offline 
  browsing. It's possible to schedule multiple grabber projects to run them once 
  at a specified time, stop them at a specified time, or run periodically to 
  synchronize changes.
* IDM supports many types of proxy servers. For example, IDM works with Microsoft
  ISA, and FTP proxy servers.
* IDM supports main authentication protocols: Basic, Negotiate, NTLM, and 
  Keberos. Thus IDM can access many Internet and proxy servers using login name 
  and password.

  It's easy to download multiple files with this feature.
* Download Categories. IDM can be used to organize downloads automatically using 
  defined download categories.
