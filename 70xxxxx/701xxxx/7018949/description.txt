Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with Marc Morano, the man behind the Climate Depot, a website that regularly publishes articles questioning man-made global warming. Morano is the former communications director for Senator James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the minority chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. 

Alex also talks about the latest attack on the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence from the New York Times and the effort by the globalists to destroy our heritage of liberty. 

Alex also covers the latest news, including continued preparations for war and false flag terror attacks.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
