Juxtapoz magazine presents a gallery of underground artists who influence much of the fashion, graphics, and new art we see today, and its readers are the tastemakers who discern the newest cultural trends. Full-color layouts presenting painters, street artists, sculptors, cartoonists, and photographers are featured along with interviews, rare portfolios, sketches, and reviews. Juxtapoz is the brainchild of Robert Williams, world-renowned artist and father of the widely popular school of cartoon surrealism. Target audience is teens to hip adults.
