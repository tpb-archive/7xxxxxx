The long-overdue reissue of Ted Lucas' one solo LP (1975) is a collaborative effort between Yoga Records, Sebastian Speaks, and Riverman Music. It took a long time because we wanted to get it right. We want to say thanks for your patience.

Time for the world to hear this masterpiece.

Ted Lucas flirted with fame in the late 60s in the Spike Drivers and Misty Wizards, studied with Ravi Shankar, went home to Detroit and played sitar for Motown, and recorded his album, referred to by family and friends as The OM Record (after Ted's private label name), in Detroit and Nashville.

Today the album is a cult favorite with few parallels. Ted Lucas, forgotten for so many years, is finally achieving the international recognition that eluded him in life. (text taken from http://yogarecords.com/artists/tedlucas/)
