The island of Djerba, located in the Gulf of Gabes off the coast of Tunisia, is not only the largest island of North Africa but also a popular destination for tourists, scuba divers and water sports enthusiasts. With just over 500 square kilometers in size, tourists have a short travel from the airport to their hotel after landing at the only airport of the island, Djerba-Zarzis.

Now that the political situation in Tunisia has calmed down after the Arab Spring, it is about time to pay this wonderful holiday destination a visit. With this add-on you can finally fly to Djerba, so fasten your seat belts, bring your seat back in an upright position and enjoy the flight!
