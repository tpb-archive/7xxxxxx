    notes: please notice that the burned subtitles (in the dvd) overlay      
    both active video and matting (black bars), therefore cropping to the    
    bottom of the subtitles is permissible, and an equal amount of           
    matting shall be left at the top. See tdx. This means that AR is         
    2.05, not 2.35. Enjoy!
