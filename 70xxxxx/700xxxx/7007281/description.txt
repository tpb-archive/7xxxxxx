Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, February 3 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Ben Fuchs in-studio. Ben hosts the nationally syndicated radio program on GCN, "The Bright Side," and is a registered pharmacist, nutritionist, cosmetic chemist and founder of EconoComp Pharmacy and Rocky Mountain Natural Laboratories. 

Alex also talks with regular Friday guest Bob Chapman, publisher of the International Forecaster, and confronts the latest news, including serious developments on the Iran front over the last 24 hours that indicate an attack against the Islamic nation is received a green light.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
