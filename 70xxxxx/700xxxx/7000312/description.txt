         Just the whiff of a foul odor can make your head spin,        
         your eyes water, your stomach turn--it can even send you      
         hurling. From cesspools, military stink bombs, and rancid     
         rotting meat... to cow farms and landfills... to bad          
         breath, B.O and beyond, the world is full of stink--and       
         we've spent centuries battling the funk. So how do we deal    
         with these horrific odors? Hold your breath `cause these      
          sensational stories are gonna STINK!
