if having problems try right clicking on patch and run as admin .. good luck   

... in there own writing

heres what one person told me that worked for them in windows 7 64bit
For Win 7 (maybe Vista too) 64 bit users, here is what I did to get it to work.
- Ran the file 'DVDFab Platinum v8.1.3.6 Qt Final + Patch'
- Chose to run the setup at the top.
- On install, chose a custom install path. Rather then let it install to the 'Program Files (x86)', erase the (x86). So the path would be 'c:Program FilesDVDFab 8 Qt (32-bit)'
Note: I appended (32-bit) to the name so I would remember that it's a 32-bit app and not 64-bit.
- From the first launch window of DVDFab, choose 'Patch or Crack'. A explorer window should pop up that points to 'C:UsersJoeAppDataLocalTempir_ext_temp_0AutoPlayDocsPatch And Crack'
- Open the 'or Crack' folder.
- Copy the 'msvcr90.dll' file to your 'c:Program FilesDVDFab 8 Qt (32-bit)' folder. Rename the original if needed.
- Go back to your 'Patch and Crack' folder.
- Open the 'DVDFab.Products.v8.x.x.x.Multi.Patch.v1.1-BBB' folder
- Launch 'Patch'
- Press the 'P' button.
- Navigate to your 'c:Program FilesDVDFab 8 Qt (32-bit)' folder and select the 'msvcr90.dll' you copied over from earlier.
- Click 'Open'
That should do it. Open DVDFab and verify that it says in the field "License Expires" it says "Never Expires"
