                           DESCRiPTiON 

 If you had the chance to banish something into Room 101, what would it be and 
 why? Room 101, hosted by Nick Hancock (seasons 1-3) and then Paul Merton      
 (season 4 onwards), gives people the chance to do so. They tell Nick Hancock, 
 later Paul Merton, why it should be banished forever and then Nick Hancock,   
 later Paul Merton, decides on whether it should be forever banished to the    
 depths of Room 101.                                                           
                                                                               
 When the show retuned in 2012 after a four year gap, Frank Skinner took over  
 as host and the show also moved to BBC One. 
                                  
                                 Enjoy!
