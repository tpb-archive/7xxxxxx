MathType is a powerful interactive equation editor for Windows and Macintosh that lets you create mathematical notation for word processing, web pages, desktop publishing, presentations, elearning, and for TeX, LaTeX, and MathML documents.


More Ways to Create Equations:

* Entering Math by Hand: Enter equations as easily as you would
  write math with paper and pencil! This feature uses the built-in
  handwriting recognition in Windows 7.

* Point-and-Click Editing with Automatic Formatting: Create
  equations quickly by choosing templates from MathType's palettes and
  typing into their empty slots. MathType applies mathematical spacing
  rules automatically as you type.

* Keyboard Shortcuts: Save time using keyboard shortcuts. MathType
  has customizable keyboard shortcuts for virtually every symbol,
  template, and command.

* Type TeX or LaTeX: If you already know the TeX typesetting
  language, you can enter equations directly into MathType or Microsoft
  Word documents. TeX editing can be mixed with point-and-click editing
  so you get the best of both worlds. You can even paste in equations
  from existing TeX documents.

* Copy-and-Paste: If you created your equation in another application or
  found one on a website, why take the time to create it by hand again?
  Simply copy-and-paste it directly into MathType, and it is ready to edit
  or use in your work.

* Save Expressions in the Toolbar: Drag frequently used equations and
  expressions to the MathType toolbar so they can be inserted later with
  just a click or a keystroke.

* Microsoft Office 2007 & 2010 â€” MathType Ribbon Tab in Word
  and PowerPoint: MathType takes full advantage of Office's Ribbon
  User Interface making it easier than ever to do equation operations in
  documents and presentations. New equation numbering and browse
  features work with all Word equation types.

* Microsoft Office 2003 and XP (2002) â€” MathType Toolbar and
  Menu in Word and PowerPoint: MathType adds a toolbar and menu
  to Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, allowing quick access to its features
  and powerful commands to do equation numbering, produce great
 -looking math web pages, presentations, and much more.

* Find Symbols: MathType's Insert Symbol dialog allows you to
  explore the available symbols and insert them with a click or keystroke.

More Control:

* Color: Use color to highlight part of an equation and focus your
  audience's attention on just the portions you want. Show what changed
  in each step of a multi-step procedure and make those equations really
  come to life.

* More Fonts: MathType has hundreds more symbols and templates
  than Equation Editor. Besides our exclusive Euclidâ„¢ math fonts, you
  can also make use of the 1000s of math symbols in fonts already on
  your computer, as well as other math fonts you can download from the
  Internet.
