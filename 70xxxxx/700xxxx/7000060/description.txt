       Veedu Theda directed by Chinni Krishna has hit the screens. Nikhil, who acted in films like Happy Days and Yuvatha, is the hero. The film released without any hype or expectations and the main curiosity factor as to see how Chinni Krishna, a protege of VV Vinayak, has done the job in his debut film.

Story:
Katthi Seenu (Nikhil) is a happy go lucky fellow. His needs are taken care by his sister Hema and brother-in-law Krishna Bhagawan. He does things in his own style and hence he is nicknamed Veedu Theda. However, Seenu meets Meghana (Pooja Bose) at this juncture and it is love at first sight for him. But Meghana avoids all his overture and despite his best attempts, he does not succeed in making her to fall in love with him. Meghana has a disturbed past. Seenu now tries to unravel the mystery behind her behavior. At the same time, we have Sayaji Shinde running an illicit liquor den. He sells the illicit liquor in Hyderabad and makes a lot of money. However, he is shacked with the news that Durga (Suman), who is lodged in Chanchalguda jail, is coming out after 14 years. Why is Sayaji afraid of Durga? Who is Meghana. How does Seenu unravel the mystery and finally win the trust and love of Meghana. All this form the basis for the remaining part of the story.

Performance:
Nikhil has done decent job. His expressions during emotional scenes are not praise worthy. He dances well and is okay in the fight scenes. Newcomer Pooja Bose looks fine but she cannot act. Sayaji Shinde appears in yet another routine role. Suman appears in a brief role and he does justice to it. Big names like Brahmanandam, Ali, Venu Madhav, Krishna Bhagawan, MS Narayana, Raghu Babu, Bharat and others are there in the film but the comedy has not come out well. Most of the scenes are routine stuffs and have been seen in films several times. The comedy track of Ali and Nikhil, Ali and Bharat, Ali and Geeta Singh, Raghu Babu and MS Narayana and other scenes do not evoke much laughter. MS Narayana"s attempt to parody Rajni"s Robo, Balakrishna"s Simha and Pawan Kalyan"s Jalsa does not have the desired effect. Even Venu Madhv"s mimicry of Balayya, Nagarjuna and others are not praiseworthy. Chakri"s music is okay and the songs have been picturised well. Apart from this, there is hardly anything that is worth mentioning in the movie.

Analysis:
Chinni Krishna became popular for his role as hostel warden in the film Kotha Bangaru Lokam. He now makes his debut as director with Veedu Theda. The director has tried all the routine formula tricks like songs, action, fights, comedy and a little father-daughter sentiment. Still the film does not evoke much interest and it just runs on and on with very little happening.

Verdict:
The director"s inexperience is seen clearly on the screen. He has tried to add too much to the film in his eagerness to churn out a potboiler but has not succeeded. Veedu Theda is yet another routine formula film that is below average.
