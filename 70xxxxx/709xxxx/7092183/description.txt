Description

Plot: Before the body-threatening antics of Jackass came crashing into public consciousness, there was Ontario’s Ralph Zavadil, aka Cap’n Video, who cascaded off roofs into snowbanks, jumped off ladders into half-empty swimming pools, and drank eggs through his nostrils. Beauty Day is a rambunctious documentary about this irrepressible pioneer of local-access cable shenanigans who entertained and outraged viewers in the small city of St. Catharines-until a special Easter Show, featuring a fat rabbit and adorable puppies (none of which were hurt), got him kicked off the air for good. With a nod to Werner Herzog, Cheel follows the life and times of Cap’n Video and finds that the Cap’n is still quite a firecracker.
