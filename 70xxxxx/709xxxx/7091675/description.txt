As always, the STEX DVD Team has picked out some of the very best files submitted to the Simtropolis Exchange, organized and collected all on a single disc for your enjoyment. Some of these you've surely seen before, and some you might have missed, but we're sure there is definitely something for everyone. This collection contains over 1600 files that we consider are some of the best that were contributed over a period of two years (between 2007-2008), including over 1300 BATs, 200 Lots and 100 
maps (not to mention dozens of dependency packages).
