Soulver helps you do quick calculations and work things out. It's quicker to use than a spreadsheet, and smarter and clearer than a traditional calculator.

You type out your problems as you would on paper, and Soulver calculates your answer as you type. You can do calculations over multiple lines, and use words alongside your numbers so they make sense.

Soulver is great for adding things up, easily doing percentages, and converting things, like currencies.

* See all your calculations all the time, and go back and change any of them.

* Use words amid your calculations so your numbers make sense

* Easily do percentages ("$100 - 10%", "30 as a % of 200")

* See a running total of all your lines

* Do easy conversions ("10 USD in Euros, "25 meters in feet")

* Do calculations with stocks ("100 AAPL")

* Connect your lines together using answer tokens.
