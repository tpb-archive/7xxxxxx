RELEASE NOTES

Why would you want to pay the same price or even more for other
software that has only a small fraction of Auction Auto Bidder's
features, is harder to use, or isn't reliable? Many people are
switching to Auction Auto Bidder after trying the others, make
the right choice now and save your money. With the 60 day
satisfaction guarantee, you have nothing to loose.

Why snipe (bid in the last seconds) rather than use eBay's
proxy-bidding?

Win items at a lower cost since no one will have time to outbid
you, if you bid a long time before the end, eBay will email the
previous high bidder to let them know they've been outbid so
they will most likely come back and outbid you causing the
price to increase, this software prevents this and often pays
for itself on the first use
Increase your chances of winning since people wont have time to
outbid you
You can decide to remove your bid up to the last minute since
it is only sent to eBay in the last seconds

Also works as a fully featured web browser optimized to make
browsing eBay faster & easier.

What are bid groups?

With bid groups, you can find several listings of an item you
want, add them all to be sniped and place them in a group. Place
bids from lowest to highest for the auction ending the soonest to
the latest respectively (for example, a $30 bid on the listing
ending in 2 hours, a $35 on the one ending in 17 hours, and a $40
on the one ending in 1 day). By doing this, the software will
attempt to win the first one at your lowest bid, if it wins, all
other bids in the group are canceled, if you're outbid, it will
try to win the second one and so on. This can double your savings
compared to using only normal sniping and saves you even more
time!

Very easy to use

Auction Auto Bidder is so simple to use that anyone, including
novice computer users can be using it within minutes without even
having to read instructions, thanks to the user friendly
interface and wizards which make installing and setting up a
snipe as simple as entering your maximum bid! Auction Auto Bidder
will automatically retrieve the item details and do the rest.

changes, specified amount of time left, price exceeds specified
amount)
Notifications of sellers with poor feedback or who do not

Bid group support (group several auctions of an item you want,
and the software will automatically attempt to win one after
the other in the group until one of them is won at your maximum
bid or less, and then cancels the bids on the other items in
the group, this prevents you from having to wait and see if you
are outbid and then find another item)
