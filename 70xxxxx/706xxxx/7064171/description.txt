This is the Ultimate Office and Windows Activator AIO tool. It will activate all Versions of Microsoft Office 2010 including standalone applications like Word, Excel etc and Windows 7 (Pro and Enterprise ONLY!!) via KMS style activation.


Requirements:
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
Office 2010 for Office Support 
Windows NT 6 era operating system (Vista or later) for Windows Support


Microsoft Toolkit Changelog:

2.3 Final
-Fixed Update check bugs (BETA 9 and earlier will fail to know about this update and will get an error).
-Now no longer requires .NET 4.
-Readme is still out of date, and since I'm working on 3.0 for W8/Office 15, I likely won't do much with 2.X.
-When downloading updates for Office 2010, all updates not on the list that aren't OCT get deleted as they are superseded.

BETA 9
-Added function to download and integrate all updates in Customize Setup
-Fixed Product detection issues in Customize Setup

BETA 8
-Added Permissions Fix during a Restore and Improved Office Rearm Check Success Rate
-Added Program Update Check on Startup
-Added support for UDF Office ISO\\\\\\\'s
-Added Functions to directly Check and Show Keys in the DigitalProductID.
-Channel Changing does patching via code instead of using xdelta3.exe and no longer needs to write patches to disk
-Customize Setup disables channel change button if setup.exe is not from Office 2010, so you can use it to integrate Office 2007 Updates/Languages.
-Enhanced error checking/messages on KMSEmulator failure.
-Fix MAK Activation Count always failing
-Fix Restoration of Phone Activation ending up in grace
-Fixed Scheduled Tasks not running as SYSTEM
-KMS PID is set before start instead of editing process memory when using manual Activation
-Preliminary Windows 8 Key Decoding
-Removed options and unnecessary fixes from EZ-Activator
-Scheduled tasks now keep the last run time and result
-Timing of Activation Restore
-Updating Settings or PID via EZ-Activator will update AutoKMS/AutoRearm. 
This is because changing settings but not the EXE could cause a INI mismatch so AutoKMS/AutoRearm would revert to default settings.
-Using ReSharper for automatic code refactoring

-Can install AutoRearm alongside AutoKMS, allowing AutoRearm to be a failsafe.

-Disable and check Save/Restore keys in Windows since Windows backup needs this.
-Fix tokens permissions on restore in case of bad permissions.
-Key Checker doesn\\\\\\\'t require Office or Windows Vista+ to use.
