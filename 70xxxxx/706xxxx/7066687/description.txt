Spider-Man 51-98 Repacked No Ads

Peter Parker: Spider-Man (originally titled simply Spider-Man), was a monthly comic book series published by Marvel Comics that ran for 98 issues from 1990-1998. The series was retitled Peter Parker: Spider-Man with issue #75, but only on the covers (the series was still under its original Spider-Man title in the comic's legal indicia, printed on the title page, from #75-98; the comic book would not officially be titled Peter Parker: Spider-Man until the Vol. 2 series relaunch). The series originally was conceived as a showcase for Todd McFarlane. McFarlane, who until then had only been known as an artist, was hugely popular at the time and the series was created by editor Jim Salicrup so that McFarlane could pencil, ink, and write a Spider-Man title of his own, starting with the "Torment" storyline. Though panned by critics,[citation needed] the series was a massive sales success. McFarlane stayed on the title until issue #16 in 1991. He would go on to create the character Spawn and help found Image Comics in 1992.
