RELEASE  NOTES

NOTE: This is the x86 version only, so before you
start bitching about the x64 release, read here
what the author of Sandboxie has to say:


"Since the crack has to be in the driver part
of Sandboxie, and since 64-bit Windows
requires drivers to be signed, how many
crackers do you think will spend money to get
a certificate so they can re-sign the driver?"

So are you willing to pay MS for a certificate
to sign your cracks? Perhaps not, that's why
you may disable driver signing in Windows 7.


Note also that the 64-bit edition of Sandboxie
provides only a reduced level of protection as
compared to the 32-bit edition of Sandboxie.
Moreover, some editions of 64-bit Windows 7
can also run the 32-bit edition of Sandboxie
in Windows XP Mode.


Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space
which prevents them from making permanent changes to
other programs and data in your computer.

Benefits of the Isolated Sandbox
* Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser
under the protection of Sandboxie means that all
malicious software downloaded by the browser is
trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded
trivially.
* Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and
cached temporary files collected while Web
browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into
Windows.
* Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious
software that might be hiding in your email can't
break out of the sandbox and can't infect your
real system.
* Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in
Windows by installing software into an isolated
sandbox.

Sandboxie has originally been designed to increase
the security of browsing with Internet Explorer,
however it is just as effective with any other
browser, and in fact, any other program. Sandboxie
wraps a protection layer around the programs it
supervises. It is this layer that intercepts and
isolates any changes the programs make to the
computer. And this layer is impartial to the
specific program it wraps.

Sandboxie was designed as an application that will
allow you to isolate and quarantine websites. When
you browse the web, changes occur to your computer
system. Most of the time these changes are harmless,
like recording the addresses of web sites you have
visited (and when), so the browser can help you
complete a web address that you type in. Whether
these changes are harmless or harmful, they do in
fact happen to your computer system.

When you use Sandboxie to protect your browsing
session, it catches all these changes just as the
browser is about to apply them into your computer
system. Sandboxie does record these changes on
behalf of the browser, but it records them in a
special isolated folder, called the sandbox.

The benefit of having a sandbox is that it ensures
your ability to get rid of all changes done by the
browser, simply by deleting the sandbox folder.

Another useful feature of Sandboxie is the ability
to terminate all sandboxed programs at once. As some
web sites tend to pop up three new browser windows
for each one you close, you can have Sandboxie close
all of them with a click of a button.
