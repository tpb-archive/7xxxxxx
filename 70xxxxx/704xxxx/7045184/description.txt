The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 19 February 2012


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On this Sunday, February 19 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex broadcasts live from the road in Dallas, Texas. He talks with Underwear bomber witness and Michigan attorney Kurt Haskell and former newspaper journalist and New York Times best-selling author Jim Marrs. 

He also covers a number of current issues, including more steps in a move toward an attack on Iran and a war in the Middle East that will expand into a Third World War and deal a final blow to a teetering global economy as a ruthless corporate and bankster elite attempt to consolidate power and usher in a New World Order and its authoritarian police state control grid.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
