This is a brilliant piece of work from the genius of witer/Director Monsieur
Francois Girrard of Quebec along with Mr. Don McKellar as co-writer. 

If you love something that's beautiful, shouldn't you take good care of it
to prevent it falling into the wrong hands where it cannot be as properly 
appreciated - of at all?

How much sacrifice in sweat tears and even blood have we had to go through
and invest into our that which we most cherished is seen as worth valuing
enough to protect?

Have we been able to maintain what is of beauty in our midst over time
or have we abdicated through lack of care and vigilance

Who is it that is most deserving of whatever is most beautiful in the first
place - surely not all are equal in merit in this respect. Whether the
analogy of what is beautiful is to include a beautiful woman (without
whom mankind has no existence) just as much as a beautiful violin depends
 on how far you would wish to take it I suppose - even all the way perhaps!

Multiple languages used n this movie include glorious German Italian French
and mainly English - subtitles are optionally included for the non English
spoken bits, along with Dutch Romanian Spanish and Portuguese. These
subs will work with our previously posted 720p versions too!

Greta Scacchi looks a bit tired from neglect - however she is the most 
beautiful gal in the world in her "White mischief" movie appearance and
for her spirit its something she will never lose in her own merited rightness
of mind


Enjoy this masterpiece that should put you on your guard to protect
what is your own survival in the way of culture and belongings - of whatever
manner
