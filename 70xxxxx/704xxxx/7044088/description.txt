movie review comments:

There are no greater peoples in my own way of thinking on these matters
than those true Irish spirits of Germany and their relative kin in
Italy most of all, along with Holland especially, Sweden and I would say France
to the fullest extent that I would love to see my dream of unification between 
these German states (Germany-austria-Holland-Sweden) combined with France
into a formal state with Italian and Spanish integration in some way in a
manner that ensure the spirit strongly yet improves while moving towards an
even truer understanding of right harmony so all can coexist that truly do belong
to the best spirit that can be made from all the peoples I mention, sensibly
combined somehow.

We must allow Germans to be the best they can be - and imposition of 
communistic ideas is an anathema to the Irish spirit - yet a cruel world
chose to impose it on fully half of the German Nation at the end of the
second world war, rather than just placing the blame where it lay - 
at the grave of Hitler himself and settle for that.

This movie deals with how Germans tried to cope with the secret Police
apparatus and the difficult situations in what was a world devoid of human
understanding on such issues as personal space free of state orchestrated
harassment, directed by the Soviet Bloc hierarchy overall. It was also the
wrong prescription for the great peoples of Russia too for that matter -
speaking of those that are truly Irish spirited folks there too I might add.
