The new edition of Marchewa\\\'s Information Technology Project Management focuses on more simplified chapters, practical examples and the addition of small case studies to every chapter. The text contains the same level of depth and brevity that\\\'s simply written and easy to understand as previous issues. Marchewka continues to focus on how to create measurable organizational value (MOV) to create a solid foundation for making decisions throughout the project\\\'s lifecycle as well as for integrating project management and IT concepts, tools, and techniques.
