 Fortunately you have got
 Someone who relies on you
 We started out as friends
 But the thought of you just caves me in
 The symptoms are so deep
 It is so much too late to turn away
 We started out as friends

 Sign your name
 Across my heart
 I want you to be my baby
 Sign your name
 Across my heart
 I want you to be my lady

 Time I'm sure will bring
 Disappointments in so many things
 It seems to be the way
 When your gambling cards on love you play
 I'd rather be in Hell with you baby
 Than in cool Heaven
 It seems to be the way

 Birds never look into the sun
 Before the day is gone
 But oh the light shines brighter
 On a peaceful day
 Stranger blue leave us alone
 We don't want to deal with you
 We'll shed our stains showering
 In the room that makes the rain

 All alone with you
 Makes the butterflies in me arise
 Slowly we make love
 And the Earth rotates
 To our dictates
 Slowly we make love
