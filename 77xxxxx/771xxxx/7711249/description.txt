NOTES

Audiosurf is a music-adapting puzzle racer where you use your own
music to create your own experience. The shape, the speed, and the
mood of each ride is determined by the song you choose. You earn
points for clustering together blocks of the same color on the
highway, and compete with others on the internet for the high score
on your favorite songs.

Audiosurf on Steam includes The Orange Box soundtrack, integrated
with the game to enable "Still Alive" surfing and more. In
addition, Audiosurf is one of the first titles to leverage
Steamworks, offering full support for the Steam Achievements that
appear on Steam Community profile pages.

- Play with any music from your own collection--the game supports
MP3s, iTunes M4As, WMAs, CDs and OGGs
