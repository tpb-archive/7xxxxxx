P90X2 WORKOUT: THIS IS NO ORDINARY SEQUEL.

The result of 2 years of R&D conducted by a team of the most qualified experts in fitness, this is training so cutting edge, so outrageously effective, you'll be blown away by your visible results. AND your performance.

P90X2® is based on Muscle Confusion to break through normal 30-day training plateaus so you get results fast. P90X2 ups the ante with a training technique developed by professional sports trainers for world class results: P.A.P., or Post-Activation Potentiation. Don't try to remember the word, just remember that it works. Like crazy. With P90X2, you get 12 groundbreaking workouts focused on chiseling your body while building your balance, agility, core strength, and athleticism. It includes new customization with an all-new, highly flexible Nutrition Guide to help you excel.

THIS, is training. Better training than most pro athletes get. The kind of cross-training that separates posers from performers. And with emphasis on your abs/core, powerful athletic function, and lightning-bolt agility, it'll help you blast through your plateaus.


P90X2 BASE - 12 WORKOUTS

All of the workouts fall into one or more of three training phases, each with a very distinct focus.

Phase One is focused on your foundation with the goal of creating a solid attachment to the ground. Includes X2 Core, which works the core using instability; X2 Balance + Power, which incorporates strength and plyometric movements; and more.

Phase Two focuses on strength with workouts like Plyocide, combining explosive movements with mind and coordination drills; Chest + Back + Balance, the mega pump of P90XÂ® Chest & Back with the addition of unstable platforms.

Phase Three focuses on performance. You can look forward to P.A.P. (Post-Activation Potentiation) Lower and P.A.P. Upper, two separate workouts using a cutting-edge training technique used by some of the fittest athletes on the planetâ€”a series of repeated movements or "complexes" that will absolutely destroy you.
