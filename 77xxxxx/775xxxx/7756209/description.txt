A complement to your file management suite, UltraCompare Professional is loaded with features to enable you to compare text files and folders, as well as zip files and jar archives. Text file compare features include binary and text compare of two or three text files at a time, with the ability to merge text differences between compared files. Folder compare supports comparison of local/network directories (and subdirectories with recursive folder compare) and zip file compare as well, and like text/binary compare, you can merge differences between compared directories. With automatic integration with UltraEdit or UEStudio, UltraCompare Professional is a compare tool you should not be without!

Chances are if you're reading this you already use UltraEdit, but you probably don't have UltraCompare Professional yet. You may not realize how important such a text file compare tool is or how versatile it can be.

You may have even used UltraCompare Lite but are now finding that this lightweight comparison utility is not robust enough for your text editing purposes.
