King's Bounty: Warriors of the North is the next chapter in the cult
RPG/adventure saga. The new tale takes place in the familiar world of
Endoria featured in the previous games, but begins in the Viking lands,

quest in King's Bounty: The Legend

The Mighty Olaf, son of the Konung of Northlings, has dedicated his life
to battling the undead who have infested the northern lands of Endoria. He
seeks to liberate the snowy wastes, dwarven dungeons, and the very heart

necromancy. On his quest towards immortal glory he will encounter cunning
foes and new friends, hard battles and amazing adventures
