TRON: Uprising - Season 1 - Episode 8 (WEB-DL - 720p - MP4)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Inside the computer world of the grid, a young program named
Beck becomes the unlikely leader of a revolution against a
corrupt regime. His mission is to free his home and liberate
his friends from the oppressive reign of the villainous Clu
and his evil henchman, General Tesler. In this quest, Beck is
recruited and trained by Tron - the greatest warrior the grid
has ever known. Tron not only teaches Beck the fighting skills
he will need to challenge this brutal military operation, but
he also becomes a mentor and father figure to Beck as he grows
beyond his youthful, impulsive nature into a courageous,
powerful leader who can inspire an uprising.
