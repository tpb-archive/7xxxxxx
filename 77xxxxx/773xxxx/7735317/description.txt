Designed as a jumping-on point for new readers, Voice follows Rachel Grosvenor as she navigates the high-pressure social gauntlet that is her clan's "conformation" process, competing for knighthood in an attempt to win security for her mother and sister. (Lynne, however, can take care of himself.) But when the heirloom that's key to her eligibility is stolen, Rachel faces the impossible task of recovering it from the sprawling layer-cake maze of Anvard ΓÇö and fast! She's certain wandering family friend Jaeger Ayers would know where to start... but where do you turn when you need to find a "finder"? And what if you dig up one of the stray cat's payback-minded enemies first?
