Judas's Note:

For those looking at the screenshots or viewing the video and noticing that there are very "small" black bars on either side of the video, this is the way the bluray was made. Now most people would "crop" these out.. however if I were to do so, this would result in a "pixel" shift resulting in a less clear and accurate image, as the tv or display when viewed full screen would try to "fill" the few pixels in the width that aren't there via stretching it. I did this to ensure that everything would remain prestine and as close to the blu-ray as possible.
