   stepping forward to address critical problems like climate change,        
   urban sprawl, and polluted water and air. Fortunately, they have          
   dynamic, innovative models outside U.S. borders. Green Cities of Europe   
   draws on the world's best examples of sustainability to show how other    
   cities can become greener and more livable. Timothy Beatley has brought   
   together leading experts from Paris, Freiburg, Copenhagen, Helsinki,      
   Venice, Vitoria-Gasteiz, and London to illustrate groundbreaking          
   practices in urban planning. These cities are creating greenways,         
   improving public transit, conserving energy, instituting "green audits"   
   for government, and strengthening their city centers. With Green Cities   
   of Europe, Beatley offers the U.S. planning community not only a vision   
   of holistic sustainability, but a clear guide to accomplishing it at      
   home.
