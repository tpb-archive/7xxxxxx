Charles comes over to his neighbor's place to complain about his relationship problems. He brings some wine, but Rachel doesn't trust herself around alcohol on a weeknight. After listening to Charles complain about how his girlfriend doesn't like his aggressiveness, Rachel tells him that there are some girls who love a man who takes control. Charles gets the hint and they get hot and heavy right there on the sofa.
