Despite major advances in prevention and treatment, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States. The vast number of patients with cardiovascular disease coupled with ongoing clinical advances makes the Oxford American Handbook of Cardiology a must-buy for residents, fellows, and students, as well as an excellent reference guide for general practitioners. The reader will find here all the essential practice guidelines and management strategies as well as a unique chapter on preventive cardiology and a useful summary of recent major clinical trials in cardiology. Common cardiac conditions, including coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, valvular and congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure, are covered comprehensively yet concisely.
