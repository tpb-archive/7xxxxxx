Whats up pirate bay?

Havent posted anything in a while been too busy but here is a breakthrough in 3D video tech from Sick Flix for the EVO 3D


Introducing QSBS  1920x540  for the HTC EVO 3D

NOW HAVE FULL SBS converted to QSBS  3840x1080  converted down to 1920x540

When the frames are packed properly by me, you get a 960x540 when overlapped with TWICE the data TWICE the quality TWICE the 3D Effect.

NOTE these wont work on 3D TV\'s like original sick flix--
  they will ONLY work on the following devices:

HTC EVO 3D
a 3D laptop
on a computer using a 3D player.





NOW CONVERTING TONS OF QSBS!!!

YOU CANT FIND SHIT LIKE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET!!!!
