This is a spooky 3D video I made of the forest behind my house. You can play it at your Halloween party. It's 1080p, so you can play it from a laptop/PS3/Roku or burn it to a Blu-ray disc, or burn it in standard def to a DVD, and play it on any player or television combo. All you need are RED/CYAN anaglyph glasses to see the 3D [I found some really cheap 3D glasses for sale here: http://amzn.to/uoPAeL ] It's about 5 minutes long, with a really spooky soundtrack that you can play on a loop indefinitely. ENJOY!
