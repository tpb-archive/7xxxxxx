Young, horny high school couples are being horribly mutilated by demonic Puritans. Time for Fluffy to take a study break and kick some supernatural ass! Meanwhile, Fluffy's pals are wagging their tongues at the hot new substitute teacher - Vampirella. When the iconic vampire and the teenage warrior face off, the clash is more epic than stripes and polka dots! Vampi continues to tear her way through pop-culture vampirism in dark, brutal - and cathartic - satire from writer Mark Rahner (Vampirella Annual #2, Rotten).
