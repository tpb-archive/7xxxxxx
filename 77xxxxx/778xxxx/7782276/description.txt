WOMEN OF THE WORLD (1963) - 
From the Mondo Cane Collection box set

English subtitles with GRATEFUL DEAD soundtrack
(Original film soundtrack not available)

AVI (Xvid) ripped from DVD-R at 1400/kbs
Audio - AC3 (Dolby Digital) 256 kbs (very good quality)

I've decided to share this hybrid with the world. I'd post this movie with its original soundtrack (narration and cheesy music) but the fact is that I don't own it anymore. All I have is this disc I made using the Grateful Dead's Dicks Picks #28 (recorded February 1973 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Salt Lake City, Utah).  Pretty good musical soundtrack, beginning with "Dark Star" and ending with "We Bid You Goodnight." In between, some very cool music to see a film with.

After a while you'll forget that the movie & the music don't belong together.

There is a "Mondo Cane Collection" torrent on Pirate Bay (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4785689/Mondo.Cane.Collection.DVDRip.1962-1971.%5B5.Movies%5D.%5BGS%5D) but it's missing WOMEN OF THE WORLD!  Which is part of the collection! I know because that's how I acquired it.

Enjoy responsibly and please share. Thanks.
