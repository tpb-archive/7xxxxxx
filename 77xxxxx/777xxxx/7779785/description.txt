  The film is based on the life and times of a    
  superstar heroine from the dream factory we call
 'Bollywood'. The film is a daring, shocking      
  glamorous, scandalous behind the scenes         
  account of the reality behind the world of      
  glitz and glamour that our film stars inhabit.  
  For a country obsessed with films and film      
  stars,  Heroine will take audiences on a       Þ
  voyeuristic journey to see what really goes on  
  behind the closed doors of make up rooms       °
  and vanity vans. It will give them a chance to °
  go beyond the gorgeous smiles and politically   
  correctquotes, to see what really happens in    
  the lives of India's sweethearts. The bitching  
  and the politics, the secrets and the lies, the 
  incredible highs of fame and the lonely         
  depths of failure.
