- Copy the .raw file to an USB stick using SUSE Studio Image Writer  
http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Live_USB_stick#Download_ImageWriter

If you have error during copy, eject and re-connect the pen drive. When Windows asks if you want to format it, cancel and run Image Writer again.

If the problem persists, disable your anti-virus software, it may be blocking raw write to the drive.

- Boot the USB drive and install.

Default boot loader is Clover

If you want to use Chameleon press 1 at boot0 screen

If you need, use TransMac to delete kexts which are causing problems (System/Library/Extensions) and delete Extensions.mkext (System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup)

If boot stops right before reaching the installer, or graphics aren't working right, delete video kexts:
ATI = ATI*
Intel = AppleIntelIntegratedFramebuffer and AppleIntelGMA*
nVidia = GeForce* and NVDA*

You need at least one free partition, use Disk Utility (in the Utilities menu) to erase it as Mac Os Extended (Journaled).

If you want to install the boot loader in this partition and you use MBR (not GUID, like if you already have Windows in the HD), it must be a primary (not extended/logical) partition.

Wait for the installation to finish and restart.


- Boot the USB drive, then choose to boot the HD you just installed OS X (not the installer USB again).


- Install boot loader to the HD.


- Install essential and other kexts you may need (network, audio, etc).

FakeSMC.kext is always needed

While you don't have power management fixed, you will probably need NullCPUPowerManagement.kext

If you use PS/2 keyboard or a laptop you will need VoodooPS2Controller.kext (or ApplePS2Controller.kext) and AppleACPIPS2Nub.kext

- When you format the USB drive as FAT/NTFS you'll notice its size was reduced. Just open Disk Management (Administrative Tools), remove the 7 GB partition and create a new one using all the drive.
