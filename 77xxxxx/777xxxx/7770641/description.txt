Product Description
With the full force of IMAX cinematography, Arabia 3D takes viewers deep into an exotic land steeped in 2,000 years of ancient history and unique customs not found anywhere else in the world. As if on a magic carpet ride across this desert kingdom, audiences will discover the lost city of Madain Saleh, explore its ancient tombs, travel with a camel caravan along the early frankincense trade route, survive a desert sandstorm, dive the coral reefs and shipwrecks of the Red Sea, experience the warmth of the world-famous Beduoin hospitality, and join in the annual hajj pilgrimage, where 2 million Muslims gather in Meccah in the single largest gathering of people on Earth. They will also discover modern day Arabia, which finds itself in the midst of monumental change. Bonus features include trailer, Making Of and MF short retrospective.
