Deterring Democracy is a book published in 1992 by Noam Chomsky, which explores the differences between the humanitarian rhetoric and imperialistic reality of United States foreign policy and how it affects various countries around the world.
In the book, Chomsky explores the idea that the US is the only remaining world superpower that works to maintain its dominance, even ruthlessly employing violence such as outright invasions and overthowing governments pursuing independent economic policies. He also discusses the large difference between public opinion on the Cold War, establishment American educated opinion and reality.
The book also contains criticism aimed at the Soviet Union and other communist states, but makes a major point to the fact that if the United States really supported "freedom" in the cold war, then why did it still support authoritarian regimes? The conclusion that Chomsky comes to is that the U.S did not really care about supporting freedom, but rather maintaining dominance over resources and geopolitical power.
