This particular album was released November 4th, 1986. I originally brought the audio tape version of this with me to Thailand during the early 90's where I was sent to study Buddhism as a teenage boy. That tape is long gone, however it's transporting melodies imprinted upon me and I would often find myself recalling them from memory during times of trial and hardship. A few years ago I tried to find this album again, to no avail, but since then I have finally found it and wanted to share it with other's so that they may benefit from it as well.
