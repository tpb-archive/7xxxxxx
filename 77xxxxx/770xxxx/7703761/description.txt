Vox De Bulgaria S.A.G.E. bundle is the very first massive (1.2Gb) vocal pack containing solo, duo, trio and choir grooves turning the standard Stylus RMX rhythm machine into an impressive musical instrument. The bundle is remarkable fore its brilliant high quality performances of a third generation young professional female folk singers. The well-known Bulgarian Voices included in this collection bring authentic Balkan ambience into any style of music compositions, film scoring and mixing. An awesome variety of up to 25 natively recorded elements per suite (E2-E4) are available for some choir grooves, giving the users the unique possibility to compose live harmony choir tracks using the RMX "Groove Menu" mode in a musical way.

All vocal grooves included in that bundle are "dry", bringing only the original acoustic ambience of the recording studio hall. This option gives the user the possibility to add some FX - as shown in the demo video of this web page. The default Stylus Attack & Release ΓÇ£ampΓÇ¥ envelope parameters can be set to custom values as well, depending on the musical material and styles whatever the vocal grooves are used for.

The vocal bundle offers additional abbreviation for all suite and element names (shown in the demo video). This addition is extremely useful in RMX "Groove Menu" mode giving information about the original key pitches of the elements, conditional "midi track" transposition of the suites, vocal phrase ranges etc. As a whole, this essential info contributes to use this exotic vocal collection in a highly musical way immersing your compositions into Balkan surrounding.
