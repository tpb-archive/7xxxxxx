JRE #294 - Ari Shaffir, Brian Redban [64k Time Warped]


This is the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #294 64k Time Warped version. Time warped means the 

audio is played 38% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)
The reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 

minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG 

aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.
