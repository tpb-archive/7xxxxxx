The Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies, and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success

In this engrossing journey into the lives of psychopaths and their infamously crafty behaviors, the renowned psychologist Kevin Dutton reveals that there is a scale of ΓÇ£madnessΓÇ¥ along which we all sit. Incorporating the latest advances in brain scanning and neuroscience, Dutton demonstrates that the brilliant neurosurgeon who lacks empathy has more in common with a Ted Bundy who kills for pleasure than we may wish to admit, and that a mugger in a dimly lit parking lot may well, in fact, have the same nerveless poise as a titan of industry.
 
Dutton argues that there are indeed ΓÇ£functional psychopathsΓÇ¥ among usΓÇödifferent from their murderous counterpartsΓÇöwho use their detached, unflinching, and charismatic personalities to succeed in mainstream society, and that shockingly, in some fields, the more ΓÇ£psychopathicΓÇ¥ people are, the more likely they are to succeed. Dutton deconstructs this often misunderstood diagnosis through bold on-the-ground reporting and original scientific research as he mingles with the criminally insane in a high-security ward, shares a drink with one of the worldΓÇÖs most successful con artists, and undergoes transcranial magnetic stimulation to discover firsthand exactly how it feels to see through the eyes of a psychopath.
 
As Dutton develops his theory that we all possess psychopathic tendencies, he puts forward the argument that society as a whole is more psychopathic than ever: after all, psychopaths tend to be fearless, confident, charming, ruthless, and focusedΓÇöqualities that are tailor-made for success in the twenty-first century. Provocative at every turn, The Wisdom of Psychopaths is a riveting adventure that reveals that itΓÇÖs our much-maligned dark side that often conceals the trump cards of success.
