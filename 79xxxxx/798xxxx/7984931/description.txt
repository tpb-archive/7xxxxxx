                           DESCRiPTiON 

 For many Londoners, the summer is a chance to escape the hustle and bustle of the 
 city in search of relaxation overseas, but as the Brits hit the beaches, the 
 capital becomes a popular destination for wealthy tourists and their supercars. 
 This documentary reveals how million-pound Bugatti Veyrons and other extravagant 
 vehicles are an increasingly common sight on the streets of central London, which 
 is leaving some residents disgruntled, but also bringing car fans to the area, 
 eager to catch a glimpse of their favourite models.

                                 Enjoy!
