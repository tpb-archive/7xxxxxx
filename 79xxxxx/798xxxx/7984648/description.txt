First off, I took the French 3D Anaglyph version, by MENASX, and stripped off the French Audio of the MP4 file.  Then, after more than a month of searching (Downloading and trying to Sync the Audio with the Video) I finally tried a HSBS Copy of the film, that was Uploaded by YIFY.  That Soundtrack Synced up perfectly with MENASX's MP4 Video.  ItΓÇÖs too bad that I wasn't able to find one with an AC3 Soundtrack.  But, I did run this through a Dolby Digital filter, and I was able to give it a faux 5.1 Soundtrack (Please note: the rear channels aren't separate.  They're one channel.)

The Video is 23.97 fps.  The original files were MP4s.

My Upload is a VIDEO_TS File.  Meaning that all you have to do is Download and burn a DVD Copy that will play in just about every DVD Player out there.  I use Nero Burning Rom.

Many thanks to YIFY and MENASX.  Because, without their copies, mine wouldn't have been possible.

I hope you enjoy my many hours of work.  LOL I just have one request, please Seed.  Too many Torrents die because many people Download and then stop Seeding when the Download completes.  Then they delete the file after they're finished with it without Seeding back to the community.
