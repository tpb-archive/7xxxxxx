The award-winning Max Payne franchise put players in the role of Max Payne, a
hard-boiled New York City detective with a penchant for violence, out to
avenge the death of his family. The latest installment delivers more of the
classic elements and hyper-intense action that fans have come to love, while
moving the story of Max in a new direction.

Since leaving the NYPD and New York itself behind, Max has drifted from bad
to worse. Double-crossed and a long way from home, Max is now trapped in a
city full of violence and bloodshed, using his weapons and instincts in a
desperate search for the truth and a way out.
