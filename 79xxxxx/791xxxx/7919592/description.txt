The Kapital stumbles upon a newly declared sovereign nation-a community of hundreds living on oil platforms with dreams of forming a new utopia. With the world's governments and economies in shambles in the post-Crash world, is this new "country" the hope for the future that Callum Israel and Ninth Wave are looking for? Or is it the divisive issue that'll bring his crew to their breaking point?

Thanks goes to theProletariat for this release.
