 British Gangsters: Faces of the Underworld gives a
 unique insider's insight into these men.
 Villains, gangsters or Faces as they prefer to be called,
 are the men, gang and family members who have made headlines
 over the past 50 years for all the wrong reasons. Some are
 household names: the Krays, the Richardsons, Paul Ferris,
 Frankie Fraser, Arthur Thompson and Vic Dark. Many you will
 not recognise, but the mere mention of these people has struck
 fear into individuals and entire communities. Despite their
 notoriety, the faces of Britain s most feared criminals remain
 largely unknown. That is until now.
 Presented by Bernard O Mahoney, best-selling true crime author
 and former member of the Essex Boys Firm, Britain s most infamous
 and influential faces are interviewed for the first time, many of
 whom have never appeared on camera before.
