FOREWORD
--------

This is a very old game from 1996 but extremely fun, and very difficult.
It is also quite difficult to install on modern Windows, as it was designed for DOS and Windows 95.  Please use the special installer that I have included which will reduce, or completely fix the distorted sound in the game.

I have a previous release on TPB but I've lost my password/email for the account, so I apologize for the repost.

SYNOPSIS
--------

Based on RAMA II, by Arrthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee.

The year is 2200, and a giant cylindrical structure has appeared on the edge of our solar system.  We call it RAMA.  You are an austronaut who is to replace another who mysteriously died during a routine medical procedure.

Explore this fascinating world, solving puzzles and unearthing a massive controversy.  You will meet other intelligent beings on this structure, but they are asking the same question as you: who are the RAMAN'S, and what is the purpose of RAMA.

----------
To Install
----------

1. Mount disk 1
2. Run the special installer msi at the root of the torrent
	-Alternatively, download installer from http://www.squirtthecat.com/games/rama/index.html
3. To play, keep disk 1 mounted and run from the start menu, or run SIERW5.exe in the game directory.

NOTES
-----

You will need to mount disc 1 to begin a new game.  Do not unmount the disc, as the game runs heavily on it.  You will need to mount the other discs when you are asked.  The third disc is bonus contnet.

The walkthrough here will be very useful.  This is a very difficult game:
