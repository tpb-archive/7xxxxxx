How did a 75-year old actor from [b]Star Trek[/b] become a social media juggernaut? 

Why does everything he posts spread like wildfire across the ether, with tens or even 

hundreds of thousands of likes and shares? And what can other sites, celebrities and 

companies do to attain his stratospheric engagement levels, which hover or top 100 

percent while theirs languish in the single digits? 
 
 
Read about George TakeiΓÇÖs meteoric rise and dominance of the Internet in Oh Myyy 

(There Goes the Internet), published of course in electronic format.
In this groundbreaking, hilarious and informative book, Takei recounts his 

experiences on platforms such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, where fans and 

pundits alike have crowned him King. He muses about everything from the nature of 

viral sharing, to the taming of Internet trolls, to why Yoda, bacon and cats are such 

popular memes. Takei isnΓÇÖt afraid to tell it likes he sees it, and to engage the 

reader just as he does his legions of fans.
 
 
 
Both provokingly thoughtful and wickedly funny, Oh Myyy! captures and comments upon 

the quirky nature of our plugged-in culture. With TakeiΓÇÖs conversational yet 

authoritative style, peppered with some of his favorite images from the web, readers 

should be prepared to LOL, even as they canΓÇÖt help but hear his words in their heads 

in that unmistakable, deep bass.
