Inside the computer world of the grid, a young program named
Beck becomes the unlikely leader of a revolution against a

his friends from the oppressive reign of the villainous Clu
and his evil henchman, General Tesler. In this quest, Beck is
recruited and trained by Tron - the greatest warrior the grid
has ever known. Tron not only teaches Beck the fighting skills

powerful leader who can inspire an uprising.
