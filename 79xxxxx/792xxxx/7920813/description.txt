Plot

Tomoki Sakurai is a teenage guy whose motto is "Peace and quiet is the best", but he finds it difficult when he has to put up with Sohara Mitsuki, his next door neighbor with a killer karate chop; Eishiro Sugata, an eccentric pseudo-scientist bent on discovering the "New World"; and Mikako Satsukitane, a sadistic Student Council President. One day, while he was witnessing a strange anomaly in the sky, an UMA (Unidentified Mysterious Animal) crash-lands nearby. Tomoki discovers what fell from the sky is a winged female humanoid named Ikaros, who soon declares herself to be Tomoki's servant. From then on, more creatures known as "Angeloids" arrive, and with this, he loses his peace and quiet, but at the same time finds pleasant things the Angeloids bring him.
