Summary
Sacred Gold and Storm Silver are the fourth set of hacks/edits I've done now; others you might be familiar with are Pokémon Fire Red Omega, Pokémon Spirit Gold, and for those of you native to GBAtemp, Pokémon Blaze Black and Volt White. Given that it's one of my hacks, it has a pretty similar style in the sense that all Pokémon are available, there's an increased difficulty curve, there are (optional) changes to Pokémon to make some of them better etcetera. You may wonder why I've chosen to make another HG/SS hack when I've done Spirit Gold previously; the answer to this question is that Spirit Gold never really took full advantage of the tools available for DS games, particularly in terms of scripting. Compared to Spirit Gold, Sacred Gold and Storm Silver are full of new scripted events and other aesthetic changes to make it both full of content and a pleasure to look at.
