This is a complete 2hr radio interview mp3 at 48k bitrate done with Howard
Stearn interviewing Martha Stewart amingst other controvertial personalities
on his risque show program discussing sexual matters in a way that gives a unique
glimpse into the failings of American society to maintain decent ideas of what
intimacy and appropriate sharing is all about.

Highlites include Martha discussing her $1200 "thumper" and her
lack of underwear whileon the show, and her ideas of black men for sex

I love to promote the Irish spirit in the best sense and think that all folks
should do the same, including those that could most let us down
if they arent truly with us on core issues for a lack of compatible
brain structure. See the Personalysis document on the wicked witch syndromme
and you'll understand why Howard Stearn and staff aint got no sense in making
Martha go along with this interview idea in the first place!
