===Release Title===

Android Games [12-29-12]

===Release Instructions===

here is a superb file manager for your android device: 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.fm 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.fm.hd

any included SD DATA folders (starting with "com") go in /Android/obb or /Android/data for non-obb files. if these directories do not exist, create them.
SD DATA not in opaque binary blob (OBB) format are compressed in a RAR archive.
this is because of the large amount of files contained within, it makes
transferring the SD DATA much easier. as a general rule these will go in
/Android/data, then the RAR must be decompressed with an android archive extraction utility. do not copy the sd data to the folders previously specified, copy the
provided folder containing the sd data to these folders.

if a game does not function correctly, attempt to patch with Lucky Patcher by ChelpuS or Google Play Store Modded by ChelpuS. tools are for rooted phones only!

if a game comes with an unlocker or add-ons/expansions, install them after the main apk. if a game still does function on your non-rooted phone, do not ask for a working non-root cracked version! find instructions to root your device!

===Release Information===
