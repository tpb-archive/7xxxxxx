Oni Ayhun is the pseudonym used by Olof Dreijer, one half of the pioneering sibling electronic duo The Knife, for his solo work. From 2008 trough 2010, Dreijer has published four vinyl and digital EPs, or as he names them, "OARs," with an additional release some time in the future. I felt this upload would be apropos given the announcement of The Knife releasing a new album in the spring.
