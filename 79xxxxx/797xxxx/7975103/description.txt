The New Yorker is an American magazine of reportage, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry published by Conde Nast. Starting as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans.
 Although its reviews and events listings often focus on the cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers; its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on politics and social issues; and its single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.
