Longing for the days when he felt like a real ogre, Shrek is duped into signing a pact with the smooth-talking dealmaker, Rumpelstiltskin. Shrek suddenly finds himself in a twisted, alternate version of Far Far Away, where ogres are hunted, Rumpelstiltskin is king, and Shrek and Fiona have never met. Now, it's up to Shrek to undo all he's done in the hopes of saving his friends, restoring his world, and reclaiming his one True Love.

There's tons of living room fun to be had in the Shrek Forever After video game, which turns Shrek into a social and team experience that the whole family can enjoy. Players can join in on the action at any time in the co-operative multiplayer mode to form a team of up to four players. Together, teams can navigate through Shrek's two realities while solving mind-bending puzzles, and fending off RumplestiltskinΓÇÖs army of baddies. Shrek, Fiona, Puss In Boots, and Donkey, all have their own unique game skills that will come in handy to progress through the game. A single-player experience is also offered, which allows the player to switch between the four characters as needed at any time.
