LetΓÇÖs be honestΓÇönobody has more fun than atheists. DonΓÇÖt believe it? Well, consider this: For nonbelievers, every day youΓÇÖre alive is a day to celebrate! And no one celebrates life to the fullest like Penn JilletteΓÇöthe larger, louder half of legendary magic duo Penn & TellerΓÇöwhose spectacularly witty and sharply observant essays in Every Day Is an Atheist Holiday! will entertain zealots and skeptics alike. 

Whether heΓÇÖs contemplating the possibility of life after death, deconstructing popular Christmas carols, or just calling bullsh*t on Donald TrumpΓÇÖs apprentice training, Jillette does not fail to shock and delight his readers. And as ever, underneath these rollicking rants lie a deeply personal philosophy and a generous spirit, which find joy and meaning in family, and peace in the simple beauty of the everyday. Every Day Is an Atheist Holiday! is a hysterical affirmation of lifeΓÇÖs magic from one of the most distinctly perceptive and provocative humorists writing today.
