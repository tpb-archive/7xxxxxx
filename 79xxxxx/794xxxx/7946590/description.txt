Masks and Mobsters - XMas Special [MonkeyBrain Comics]

During the Golden Age there was a sudden influx of costumed heroes and villains ... but how did that affect the politics and business of the Mob? How did the Crime families deal with heroes who couldnt be paid off, or even worse ... Villains who didnt pay up? Masks and Mobsters is a noir crime anthology written by Joshua Williamson with a rotating team of artists to showcase the standalone stories set in the fictional Golden City where the mob has started to fight back against those who would try to steal their piece of the pie.
