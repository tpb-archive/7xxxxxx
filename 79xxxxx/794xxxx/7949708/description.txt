Pour up drank, head shot drank
Sit down drank, stand up drank
Pass out drank, wake up drank
Faded drank, faded drank

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up
Round some people living their lifes in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in the dark room
Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, filling up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me

[Hook]
Nigga why you babysitting only two or three shots
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

[Verse 2 (Kendrick's conscience)]
(Okay, now open your mind up and listen to me Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hoping to lead you to victory Kendrick)
If I take another one down
I'mma drown in some poison abusing my limit
I think that I'm feeling the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feeling
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doing
I thought I was doing the most til someone said to me

[Hook and bridge]

I ride you ride bang
One chopper, one hundred shots bang
Hop out, do you bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots bang
I ride, you ride bang
One chopper, one hundred shots bang
Hop out, do you bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots bang

[Hook and bridge]

Aw man, where is she taking me
Where is she taking me
All I, all I, all I, all I
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar
If it do then you're like me
Making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open
I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh
Don't you feel bad
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough
