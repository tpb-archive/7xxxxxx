"Signifigant Others"

When a powerful divorce attorney who only
represented women is murdered, Castle and
Beckett are confronted with a plethora of
angry ex-husbands, any one of whom could
be the murderer. Meanwhile, Castle's ex-
wife, Meredith, moves into the loft to take
care of Alexis while she recovers from
Mono, and to make matters worse, Beckett is
also forced to move in while her apartment
is being fumigated, causing tension, humor
and more than a little awkwardness.
