Shadow Defender

A powerful tool to protect your PC

Easy, powerful and effective. Shadow Defender is the easiest-to-use solution to protect your PC/laptop from unwanted changes. 

What is Shadow Defender ?

Shadow Defender is an easy-to-use security solution (for Windows operating systems) that protects your PC/laptop real environment against malicious activity and unwanted changes.

Shadow Defender can run your system in a virtual environment called 'Shadow Mode'. 'Shadow Mode' redirects each system change to a virtual environment with no change to your real environment. If you experience malicious activity and/or unwanted changes, perform a reboot to restore your system back to its original state, as if nothing happened.

With Shadow Defender, you have the flexibility to specify which files and folders are permanently saved to the real environment. This ensures important files and folders are kept after a reboot.

Try Shadow Defender for the most effective and easy-to-use security solution.
