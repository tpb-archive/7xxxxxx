A sequel to HBO's award-winning film The Gathering Storm, Thaddeus O'Sullivan's Into the Storm stars Brendan Gleeson as the intrepid British leader whose fiery rhetoric inspired Allied forces to fight back against Hitler's Germany to with everything they've got. As the flames of war spread throughout Europe, Winston Churchill rose to the call and became a national hero, disregarding the detrimental effects his actions had on both his political career and his marriage to lifelong supporter Clemmie (Janet McTeer) in a single-minded effort to defeat one of history's greatest tyrants. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi
