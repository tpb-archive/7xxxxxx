Wicked Tuna Season 1 
Fishing is a hard life, and harder with bluefin stocks depleted. In Gloucester, Massachusetts, there's a special breed of fishermen. For generations they've used rod and reel to catch the elusive bluefin tuna. They depend on these fish for their livelihood, and the competition is brutal.
Over the next 10 weeks, the most skilled fishermen will set out in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic in hopes of catching the valuable bluefin tuna. When one bluefin can bring in as much as $20,000-they'll do whatever it takes to hook up.


1)  The Bite Is On 
Meet the fleet, as peak season begins and the adrenaline rush of "monstah" hunting hits Gloucester. We enter mid-season, but this is when the money is made and tempers run hot. Each captain loads his boat with three thousand dollars worth of fuel, bait, and ice, and heads off for open water where the blue gold is waiting. But it doesn't take long for things to sour when there's cash on the line. Part gamblers, part master fishermen, part maniacs, these captains lay everything on the line and aren't above sabotaging rivals, for the chance to hook a 500 kg Blue Fin Tuna worth $20,000.
