"Shabbat Shalom"

While the NCIS team investigates the 
link to a dead journalist and a Navy 
petty officer, Ziva is taken aback 
by the sudden emotional visit by her 
father, who she hasn't seen in more 
than two years. While Ziva questions 
the purpose of her father's visit as 
the Director of Mossad, her father 
insists he is in the U.S. strictly 
to see his daughter for Shabbat 
dinner.
