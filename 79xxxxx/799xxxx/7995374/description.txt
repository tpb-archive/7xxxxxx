Our team of archaeologists, forensic experts and historians travel to the front lines of the Battle of the Somme, a sector known as Beaumont Hamel, looking for the truth of what happened that day. They uncover medical supplies lead to the location of what may have been a front line medical post - a hub of chaos on that fateful day. And it is here that the team makes a stunning discovery: it's only a single button.
