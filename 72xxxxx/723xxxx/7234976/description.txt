Overview:
=========

Counter-Strike: Source (also known as CS or simply CS:S) is a multiplayer, team-based tactical first-person shooter video game, developed by Valve and Turtle Rock Studios. It is a remake of Counter-Strike, the 1999 modification of Half-Life. Built on the Source engine, the game was released in 2004 along with Half-Life 2. The game is the most played Half-Life 2 mod, according to GameSpy.

As in the original version, Counter-Strike: Source games pit a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing a mission (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the opposing team. Unlike Half-Life: Source, the game is a complete remake instead of a port with additional content.
