   Release Notes:

   Super Meat Boy is a tough as nails platformer where you play as an       
   animated cube of meat who's trying to save his girlfriend (who happens   
   to be made of bandages) from an evil fetus in a jar wearing a tux.       
                                                                            
                                                                            
   Our meaty hero will leap from walls, over seas of buzz saws, through     
   crumbling caves and pools of old needles. Sacrificing his own well       
   being to save his damsel in distress. Super Meat Boy brings the old      
   school difficulty of classic NES titles like Mega Man 2, Ghost and       
   Goblins and Super Mario Bros. 2 (The Japanese one) and stream lines      
   them down to the essential no BS straight forward twitch reflex          
   platforming.                                                             
                                                                            
                                                                            
   Ramping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing SMB will drag Meat   
   boy though haunted hospitals, salt factories and even hell itself. And   
   if 300+ single player levels weren't enough SMB also throws in epic      
   boss fights, a level editor and tons of unlock able secrets, warp        
   zones and hidden characters.
