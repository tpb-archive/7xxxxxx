TuneUp Utilities can make your Windows operating system faster,
more comfortable and more secure with just a few mouse clicks.
And all operations performed on the operating system are
completely safe, because all changes are monitored by TuneUp
Rescue Center and can be undone at any time. All TuneUp
Utilities modules can be accessed through a common interface
that is divided into six categories.
The software helps both beginners and experts to make Windows
meet their needs in a way that is better, easier and safer. All
important system options are explained in an easy way and can
be turned on or off at the click of your mouse. TuneUp
Utilities will then make the necessary changes in the registry
or boot files automatically. We place a high value on system
stability, so that Windows won't stop working reliably. And
most changes that you make can be undone in TuneUp Rescue
Center - easily and safely.

TuneUp Utilities automatically runs important maintenance tasks
for you, makes you aware of any problems and offers simple
solutions. This ensures performance is always at its best. A
slow and untidy computer is now a thing of the past for you.
You can also use TuneUp Utilities to customize the appearance
of your Windows system - to make working on your computer more
enjoyable.

With TuneUp Utilities you will quickly make your Windows system
faster and more convenient to use- and ensure that it stays
like this for the long term. This makes TuneUp Utilities the
perfect program for everyone: for those who would rather leave
the computer maintenance to a reliable partner as well as for
those who would rather do everything themselves.

The TuneUp Turbo Mode provides an immediate performance boost
whenever you need it. When you use your computer in the TuneUp
Turbo Mode, an analysis is performed to see which tasks,
programs and functions are currently running in the background
that are not strictly necessary. These programs are stopped or
slowed down, allowing the additional processing power gained to
be used exclusively by the Programs you are actually running.
