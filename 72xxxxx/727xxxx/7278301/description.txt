This archive includes new "Layman's Commentaries on the Holy Bible", including books on Romans and Corintthians. T.O.D. Johnston's Holy Bible studies are thoroughly researched and written from a layman's perspective. The Holy Bible commentaries are based on Bible study lessons that T.O.D. taught at Paran Baptist Church (located at 1603 Johnsonville Highway, Lake City, South Carolina). T.O.D.'s two "A Layman's Messages on the Holy Bible" series are based on a series of sermons he taught at various churches.
