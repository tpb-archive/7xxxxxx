DESCRIPTION:

A nutritional whodunit that takes readers from Greenland to Africa to Israel, The Queen of Fats gives a fascinating account of how we have become 
deficient in a nutrient that is essential for good health: the fatty acids known as omega-3s. Writing with intelligence and passion, Susan Allport tells the 
story of these vital fats, which are abundant in greens and fish, among other foods. She describes how scientists came to understand the 
role of omega-3s in our diet, why commercial processing has removed them from the food we eat, and what the tremendous consequences have been 
for our health. 

In many Western countries, epidemics of inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders have been traced to omega-3 deficiencies. 
The Queen of Fats provides information for every consumer who wants to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, arthritis, and obesity and 
to improve brain function and overall health. This important and compelling investigation into the discovery, science, and politics of omega-3s will transform 
our thinking about what we should be eating.
