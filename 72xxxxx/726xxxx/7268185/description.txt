The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

Today on this Sunday, May 13, 2012 edition, Alex breaks down the ongoing hoax that is the War on Terror, with focus on the the CIA catching the CIA in the latest "al Qaeda plot"-- admittedly led by a CIA informant. Clearly, the globalists will tell any lie to keep the population in fear and complicit in the violation of their rights. Later, Alex plays a key speech from presidential candidate Ron Paul while campaigning in Austin, Texas, as well as a speech from his son, Senator Rand Paul, as the flame of liberty becomes a family affair. Doug Hagmann discusses with Alex the impending potential for a massive civil war, created through government-sponsored crisis, and what people can do to prepare for it and how to avoid and limit exposure to its devastating consequences.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
