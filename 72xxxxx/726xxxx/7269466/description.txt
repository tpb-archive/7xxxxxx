This contains a folder which you put on a SDHC card for your Garmin Nuvi GPS.

The folder contains custom points of interest (POIs).

All the POIs are available free on the internet.  I just package it nicely for you to use.  The POIs include:

1. two sources of all redlight cameras in the USA
2. two sources of all speed cameras in the USA
3. one source of all locations that police often use for setting up speed traps

You will hear appropriate warnings when 1200 feet from a speed camera, and 600 feet from a redlight camera.

The above is current as of May 14,  2012.

Other POIs included in the SDHC folder are:
1. All hospitals in the USA
2. All highway rest areas in the USA
3. All 2meter amateur radio repeaters in the USA
4. All airports in the USA

There are no proximity alarms for these 4 POIs, but you can search for the nearest ones in your GPS.
