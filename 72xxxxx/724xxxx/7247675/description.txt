Roger Waters constructed The Wall, a narcissistic, double-album rock opera about an 
emotionally crippled rock star who spits on an audience member daring to cheer during 
an acoustic song. Given its origins, it's little wonder that The Wall paints such an 
unsympathetic portrait of the rock star, cleverly named "Pink," who blames everyone
particularly women -- for his neuroses. Such lyrical and thematic shortcomings may 
have been forgivable if the album had a killer batch of songs, but Waters took his 
operatic inclinations to heart, constructing the album as a series of fragments that 
are held together by larger numbers like "Comfortably Numb" and "Hey You." Generally, 
the fully developed songs are among the finest of Pink Floyd's later work, but The Wall 
is primarily a triumph of production: its seamless surface, blending melodic fragments 
and sound effects, makes the musical shortcomings and questionable lyrics easy to ignore.
But if The Wall is examined in depth, it falls apart, since it doesn't offer enough great 
songs to support its ambition, and its self-serving message and shiny production seem 
like relics of the late-'70s Me Generation.
