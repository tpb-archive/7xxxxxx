DESCRIPTION:

Whether you're new to Arduino and Android development, or you've tinkered a bit with either one, this is the book for you. Android has always been a 
natural fit with Arduino projects, but now that Google has released the Android Open Accessory Development Kit (the Android ADK), combining Android 
with Arduino to create custom gadgets has become even easier.

Beginning Android ADK with Arduino shows how the ADK works and how it can be used with a variety of Arduino boards to create a variety of fun projects 
that showcase the abilities of the ADK.

Mario Bohmer will walk you through several projects, including making sounds, driving motors, and creating alarm systems, all while explaining how to use 
the ADK and how standard Arduino boards may differ from Google-branded Arduinos. You aren't tied to specific hardware with this book; use what you 
have, and this book will show you how.
