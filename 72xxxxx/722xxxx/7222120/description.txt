RELEASE NOTES

THE MACHINE AGE HAS BEGUN in this immersive and atmospheric squad-based
shooter in which you need to regain control of a futuristic Tokyo from
an emerging robotic threat.

Set in 2080, the story starts when Dan Marshall and his squad are sent
to bring the robotic community under control as they begin to
infiltrate society and slowly take over undetected, leaving humans
redundant in their wake.

Thrilling encounters with highly intelligent robotic enemies require
you to think tactically, make challenging, real-time moral decisions
and build up trust with your team mates in order to guide your squad
to safety and success.

Features:

A NEW TAKE ON FUTURISTIC TOKYO - Experience dual layered Tokyo with a
run down and derelict lower city and a clean and affluent upper city.

THE CONSEQUENCE SYSTEM - Under the pressures of battle every action,
every choice and every word affects everything.

PROCEDURAL DAMAGE - Fully destructible and highly resilient robots
adapt to the damage they sustain encouraging you to analyse each
enemy, find their weaknesses and dispose of them in the most efficient
way.

WEAPON MODIFICATION AND SKILL SELECTION - Alongside a full armoury of
unique weapons, put emphasis on the skills that will benefit you.
