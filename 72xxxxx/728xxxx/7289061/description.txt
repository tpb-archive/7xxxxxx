The first issue of a (hopefully) continuing mini-series. 


Description:


"The future kind of sucks, and that goes double for Dana Stevens - she's stuck in a dead-end tamale delivery job, and she's way too old to be living with her mom. But in the online fantasy world of Jarvath, she's an elite warrior. When she slays the wife of celebrity game character King Heremoth, her fame seems all but guaranteed - that is, until the game spins totally out of control."
