FreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and
sharing cinematic art in the digital era. Our goal is to disseminate
such works of art to the widest audience possible through the channels
provided by P2P technology.

The FreakyFlicks collection is limited to those films that have played
an exceptional role in the history of cinema and its progression in
becoming a great art. Films that are usually described as classic,
cult, arthouse and avant-garde.

If you have films that fit this description feel free to share them
and participate in our community. All you need do is include this tag
in your upload and join us at the forum to announce your release.
