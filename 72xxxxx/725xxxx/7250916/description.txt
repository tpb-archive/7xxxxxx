Basic is the first theme I have created specifically to embody a more traditional "Blog-Style" feel. Basic features a very clean, easy-to-read and traditional layout that focuses on displaying your content in an orderly fashion. The theme also comes with multiple color schemes, as well as built in advertisement management, a detailed theme options page and more.
