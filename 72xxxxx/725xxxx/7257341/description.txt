Lyrics:

We're like a melody with no words
Until we figure it out
We sing
La, la, la, la, la, la

I know it's simple, yeah
But it's worked right up until now
'Cause up till now, yeah
Every day's been like a dream world, oh
But now you're not just in my head, oh no

When we remember different summers
It's like tossing your heart to see where it lands
Heads is easy
Tails is harder to plan
If we're starting all over again and again and again, oh

You know that I can't help but wonder
What's gonna happen next
I'm a little curious, oh yeah
Every star that I stood under
When you were under it too
Did you ever think about us?

I hope you did, 'cause I can tell you
That's something I'll never forget
I won't forget

If we remember different summers
It's like tossing your heart to see where it lands
Heads is easy
Tails is harder to plan
If we're starting all over again

Only friends
Just beginning
But I hope that we find it again
So we can go from here, oh

When we remember different summers
It's like tossing your heart to see where it lands
Heads is easy
Tails is harder to plan
If we're starting all over again
Again and again and again and again
Again and again and again
When we remember different summers
