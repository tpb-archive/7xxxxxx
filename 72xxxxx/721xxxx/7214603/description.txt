  Highschool geek Arnie Cunningham falls in love with "Christine", a bright
  red 1958 Plymouth Fury which has seen much better days. Setting himself
  the task of restoring the car to its original condition, his friends notice
  that the car is not the only thing that is changing. Arnie seems to spend
  more and more time with his car. He's also developed a sort of cocky
  arrogance which does not seem like the real Arnie at all.
