The Last Unicorn


The Last Unicorn is one of the true classics of fantasy, ranking with Tolkien's The Hobbit, 

Le Guin's Earthsea Trilogy, and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Beagle writes a 

shimmering prose-poetry, the voice of fairy tales and childhood:

The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she 

did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color

of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she 

still moved like a shadow on the sea.

The unicorn discovers that she is the last unicorn in the world, and sets off to find the 

others. She meets Schmendrick the Magician--whose magic seldom works, and never as he 

intended--when he rescues her from Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, where only some of 

the mythical beasts displayed are illusions. They are joined by Molly Grue, who believes 

in legends despite her experiences with a Robin Hood wannabe and his unmerry men. Ahead 

wait King Haggard and his Red Bull, who banished unicorns from the land.
