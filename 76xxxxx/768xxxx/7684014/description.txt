===============================================
The Handmaid's Tale:

Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may 
leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day 
to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures 
instead of words because women are no longer allowed to 
read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that 
the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of 
declining fertility, Offred and the other Handmaids are 
valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can 
remember the years before, when she lived and made love 
with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected 
her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and 
access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now...
Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, 
The Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire 
warning, and tour de force.
