The real target in war is the mind of the enemy commander, not the bodies of his troops." - Captain Sir Basil Liddell Hart, Thoughts on War, 1944. Cyberwarfare, cybercrime, and cyberterrorism are the tools our enemies are turning to in order to attack the "mind" of the United States. Of the 317,000,000 people in America, two-thirds of the population owns an electronic device. The DOD is probed millions of times everyday, more than $600 million are lost every year due to cyber-crime; we, the people of the United States, are vulnerable. And we face threats from every direction, whether it's a kid on a laptop in his parent's basement or a foreign nation with unlimited resources. Framed for a cyber-crime she didn't commit, FBI Special Agent Chloe Jocelyn is forced to go on the run in order to prove her innocence. With the world on her tail, Chloe discovers that Gustov Dobreff, a ruthless cybercriminal may be behind it all. Chloe seeks the help of Chase 'Rabbit' Rosen, a former black hat hacker, currently doing time in a federal penitentiary. While chasing down one of Gustov's hackers the duo is confronted by Frank Parker, Chloe's ex-boyfriend and a member of FBI cyber-crime unit. Faced with the evidence of Gustov's involvement, Frank quickly realizes that Chloe's innocence and joins them. With the world distracted by "weapons of mass disruption" it's up to our heroes to track down Gustov and stop cybergeddon before the world, as we know it, comes to an end.
