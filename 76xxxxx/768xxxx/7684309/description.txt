======================================

Cat's Cradle:


Cat's Cradle, one of Vonnegut's most entertaining 

novels, is filled with scientists and G-men and 

even ordinary folks caught up in the game. These 

assorted characters chase each other around in 

search of the world's most important and dangerous 

substance, a new form of ice that freezes at room 

temperature. At one time, this novel could probably 

be found on the bookshelf of every college kid in 

America; it's still a fabulous read and a great place 

to start if you're young enough to have missed the 

first Vonnegut craze.
