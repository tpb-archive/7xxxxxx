=================================================

The Scions of Shannara:


Since the death of Allanon, life in the Four Lands 

has drastially changed. Yet Par Ohmsford still has 

some power of the Wishsong. And when a message from 

the ancient Druid, Allanon, reaches them, Par is 

ordered to recover the long-lost Sword of Shinnara, 

and the glory that once was the Four Lands....

=================================================

The Druid of Shannara:


The battle against the evil Shadowen continues as 

Walker Boh embarks on a perilous journey to rcover 

the black Elfstone and restore the lost Druid keep 

of Paranor.

=================================================

The Elf Queen of Shannara:


"Find the Elves and return them to the world of Men!" 

the shade of the Druid Allanon had ordered Wren.

It was clearly an impossible task. The Elves had been 

gone from the Westland for more than a hundred years. 

There was not even a trace of their former city of 

Arborlon left to mark their passing. No one in the 

Esterland knew of them -- except, finally, the 

Addershag.

The blind old woman had given instructions to find a 

place on the coast of the Blue Divide, build a fire, 

and keep it burning for three days. "One will come for 

you."

Tiger Ty, the Wing Rider, had come on his giant Roc to 

carry Wren and her friend Garth to the only clear 

landing site on the island of Morrowindl, where, he 

said, the Elves might still exist, somewhere in the 

demon-haunted jungle.

Now she stood within that jungle, remembering the 

warning of the Addershag: "Beward, Elf-girl. I see 

danger ahead for you . . . and evil beyond imagining." 

It had proved all too true.

Wren stood with her single weapon of magic, listening 

as demons evil beyond all imagining gathered for attack. 

How long could she resist?

And if, by some miracle, she reached the Elves and could 

convince them to return, how could they possibly retrace 

her perilous path to reach the one safe place on the coast?

=================================================

The Talismans of Shannara:


Although some of the goals to keep Shannara safe had been 

met, the work of Walker Boh, Wren, and Par was not yet done. 

For The Shadowmen still swarmed over the Four Lands, 

poisoning all with their dark magic. Each Shannaran had a 

special death waiting for him- at the hands of The 

Shadowmen-unless Par could find a way to free them all with 

the Sword of Shannara.
