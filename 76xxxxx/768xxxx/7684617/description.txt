The Sword of Shannara:


Long ago, wars of ancient Evil ruined the world and forced 

mankind to compete with many other races - gnomes, trolls, 

dwarfs, and elves. In peaceful Shady Vale, half-elfin Shea 

Ohmsford knows little of such troubles until giant, forbidding 

Allanon, with strange Druidic powers, reveals a supposedly-dead 

Warlock Lord plots to destroy the world. 

The sole weapon against this Power of Darkness is the Sword of 

Shannara, only usable by a true heir of Shannara. On Shea, last 

of the bloodline, rests the hope of all the races. Soon a Skull 

Bearer, dread minion of Evil, flies into the Vale to kill Shea. 

To save the Vale, Shea flees, drawing the Skull Bearer after him.
