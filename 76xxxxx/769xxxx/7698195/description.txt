This torrent uses the official ISOs provided by one of Microsoft's distributors, Digital River. They are untouched ISOs, so you will still need to either buy a license key or use some sort of crack within 30 days (such as Windows Loader by Daz - http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24901-Windows-Loader-Current-release-information)

The torrent uses the webseed module in most torrent clients, meaning it downloads the content from both other bittorrent peers and from a HTTP server, in this case being Digital River's servers (hosted by Akamai, so you should get maximum speeds).

The magnet links here add the webseed URL to them, so if you're not getting a fast download and are using a modern bittorrent client, try adding the webseed address manually by downloading this torrent's hash from the site called "Torrage"; that should provide you with the webseeded version of the .torrent.

And again, sorry about the file-corruption the first version of this torrent. This torrent I tested twice on two different connections before uploading, so I am sure this one will work properly. This brings up the good point... if a Microsoft customer was downloading this .iso from Digital River's server and their download got corrupted somehow, their install would fail, and they would be fucked up :) So long live torrents!




TL;DR: Burn the ISO, boot it, buy/crack it within 30 days, and you're safe and good to go.

Enjoy and seed please!
