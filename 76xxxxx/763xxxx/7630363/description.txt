========================================================


A pirate ship carrying four children crashes on the shore of a mysterious and merciless jungle. Each child is taken by a separate tribe of animals as a means to keep the peace between the species. It is a peace that will not last. Fifteen years later the children have now become young adults and each will have to face the destiny that awaits them in the unforgiving jungle. A place where only the strong will survive. From writer Mark L. Miller and the creative minds behind Grimm Fairy Tales and the Wonderland trilogy comes the wildest and newest reinvention of a classic that only Zenescope does right!
