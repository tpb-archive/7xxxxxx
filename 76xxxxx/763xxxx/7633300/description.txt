Much more than a simple alarm clock, WakeVoice lets you interact with your phone using your voice:
 Γÿà Talk to it with custom commands to stop the alarm or activate the snooze option
 Γÿà Listen to your phone telling you about the weather, news of your choice or a personalized message while staying warm in your bed

Details:
Waking up is not an easy thing for you? You have never found the alarm clock you needed?
Why not try WakeVoice!

WakeVoice can overcome the negative aspect associated to regular alarm clocks, making your morning funnier and less difficult.

The idea is simple: when the alarm rings, you just have to talk to WakeVoice to stop the alarm or activate the reminder.

But that's not all!
Once the ringing stopped, it's your phone's turn to talk to you.
Customizable messages, weather of the day, news of your choice (RSS)... choose what you want to hear.

What's in this version : (Updated : Aug 29, 2012)

    We're using a new service to give you your daily weather forecast.
    Important : don't forget to add your country if it is not your city that is returned by the service. For instance, use "New-York,USA" or "Paris,France".

Required Android O/S : 1.6+
