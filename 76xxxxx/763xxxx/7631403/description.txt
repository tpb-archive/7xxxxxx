Sanjay Sahu (Pawan Kalyan) hails from a poor rural family at remote village in Karimnagar. His brother dies of heart disease as a child. His father commits suicide as crops fail and his mother too is no more. While going to burial ground, he repeatedly slips and swoons at a stone pillar. He plucks it out, which enrages the henchmen of a land-grabber Damodar Reddy (Mukesh Rishi). When they attack him, Sahu beats them to pulp, and disappears into a forest and joins the naxalites. During a combing operation, Sahu and a police officer (Prakash Raj) meet each other and become good companions under strange circumstances. Sahu comes to Hyderabad and duly rehabilitated as a college student.

The police officer's younger daughter Bhagi aka Bhagmati (Ileana) falls in love with Sahu. However, the cop is not willing to accept her marriage with Sahu, whom he thinks as a carefree youth without commitments. Meanwhile, Damodar Reddy is out on a vengeance mission against Sahu, as his lands are distributed among the rural poor by the naxalites.

Now, the police officer wants to get his daughter married to a decent young man (Sivaji), but he soon realizes that he is none other than the younger son of Damodar Reddy.
