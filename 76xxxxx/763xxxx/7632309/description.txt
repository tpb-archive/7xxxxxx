Once again, author Tilly Bagshawe takes up the mantle of the late, great Sidney Sheldon - and again, she succeeds magnificently. Written in the inimitable Sheldon style and based on extensive, never before published material from his private archives, Sidney Sheldon's Angel of the Dark is a thrilling tale of murder, lies, and lust that the master storyteller - the bestselling author of Master of the Game, The Other Side of Midnight, and so many other beloved classics - would have been proud to have called his own. With Sidney Sheldon's Angel of the Dark, a gripping, stylish, sexy and surprising story of a son's globe-hopping hunt for answers about his wealthy father's brutal death, confirmed Sheldon fans have good reason to rejoice. The legacy truly lives on.
