Lyrics:


They told him
Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face
You better disappear

The fire's in their eyes
And their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run
You better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood
Don't be a macho man

You wanna be tough
Better do what you can
So beat it
But you wanna be bad

Just beat it beat it
Beat it beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showing how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it beat it
Just beat it beat it
Just beat it beat it
Just beat it beat it

They're out to get you
Better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy
You wanna be a man

You wanna stay alive
Better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them
That you're really not scared
You're playing with your life
This ain't no truth or dare

They'll kick you, then they beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it beat it
Beat it beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showing how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it beat it
Beat it beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showing how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it

Beat it beat it
Beat it beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showing how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it beat it
beat it beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showing how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or who's right (3x)
