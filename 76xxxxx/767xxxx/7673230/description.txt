Notes:
Here is the first of many horror movies to come from zombiRG. We will be releasing horror films for Halloween as much as possible. Our encodes do not take away quality from the raw rips, and each encode is  movie specific. All will be HD mp4 formats. Original source is from zombiRG, none of our work is done from other encodes, every single one is ripped from our copy of the actual dvd and encoded by zombiRG. Seed till you bleed and enjoy! zombiRG also has an IRC chan in EFNET type   /join #zombiRG   in the type bar and come  ask us stuff and have a chat.
