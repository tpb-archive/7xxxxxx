Lyrics:


Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you
understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man embibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement at the
oberman
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the
childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand,
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, ocean man
Ocean man

[repeat verses]

Ocean man
