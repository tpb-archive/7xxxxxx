A girl discovers her dreamy new boyfriend wants more from the relationship than she expected — namely blood — in this teen-centric horror comedy. Cute but geeky Kate (Elaine Hurt) has a crush on Paul (Patrick Delgado), a good looking guy who works at the grocery where her family shops, and when she attends SpaceCon (an event for comic, sci-fi and fantasy fans) with her friends, she’s pleased to see he’s there as well. Kate is even happier when Paul wants some private time with her, but a kiss gives way to a bite on the neck, and Kate learns that Paul isn’t pretending to be a vampire like many folks at the Con, he’s the real thing. Paul became a blood sucker after a run-in with Vince (Devin Bonnee), an angst-y vampire the ladies swoon over, but both Paul and Kate have mixed feelings about being creatures of the night. When Kate’s pal Jason (Santiago Dietche), who carries a torch for her, puts together the pieces and realizes what’s happened, he sets out to rescue Kate from the vampires before it’s too late. My Sucky Teen Romance was written and directed by Emily Hagins, who was just eighteen years old when the project was wrapped; it received its world premiere at the 2011 South by Southwest Film Festival.
