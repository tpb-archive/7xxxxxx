Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire

The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesnΓÇÖt drink or swear, and she has the appropriate percentage of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance between her and the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand.

Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needsΓÇöand wantsΓÇöto avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by AbbyΓÇÖs resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in TravisΓÇÖs apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.
