A truley fantastic collection of 109 old maps covering
every inch of the globe. Ancient maps of superior quality,
ranging from 1.05.MB - 14.6.MB. You will be hard pressed
to find a better free collection in one folder anywhere
on the net. I have included 5 previews greatly reduced in
size for your inspection. I had to reduce the size of the
previews as most host sites will only allow up to 5MB.
Hope you like them. I found them very interesting indeed.


Sizes Range from:

1.05MB 1150 X 1476 - 14.6MB 2405 X 3900

All in jpg format.
