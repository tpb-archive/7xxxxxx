Minecraft Installer 6.1.0 for Minecraft 1.3.2

Please read the included Readme document for information on controls, and where to find information on the latest releases.

The Readme document also includes a troubleshooting section which I recommend you read if you run into trouble.

My Minecraft client comes pre-packaged in an easy to use installer, and also with several useful mods should you choose to use them.
This makes the game easy to install, and also improves your experience of the game without changing the core components, so that the game is enhanced but still relatively similar to the original.

This installer has the option to install Minecraft without any modifications whatsoever and also a modded version (read the readme for info on mods) All versions have an in-built list of cracked Minecraft servers.

I take no credit for the loader, which was created by AngelDE98, AnjoCaido, Mojang (The base), Kartracer97, Smoolak, JBExtrem, Zebz213 and others.
I merely added all the mods and the 'cracked' loader and made a convenient easy-to-use installer that gives you options =)
The mods are owned by their respective creators and I take no credit for their creation. To see the page the mods came from just check the readme.

This is an easy-to-use, user-friendly way of putting Minecraft on your computer.
