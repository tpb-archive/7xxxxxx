This is a pack of the most recent episodes, that aired between Nov 2011 and Sep 2012. I will be posting the rest of the episodes as well if people continue to seed after downloading.

The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That! is a Canadian animated television series that premiered August 7, 2010 on Treehouse TV in Canada, on September 6, 2010 on PBS Kids in the US and also in the UK on CITV and Cartoonito. The series is based on Random HouseΓÇÖs Beginner Book franchise, The Cat in the HatΓÇÖs Learning Library, and is developed by Portfolio Entertainment, Random House Children Entertainment and Collingwood OΓÇÖHare Productions.

Each episode features The Cat in the Hat (voiced by Martin Short), who leads six-year-old neighbours Nick and Sally, the Fish, and Thing One and Thing Two on a variety of adventures in his "Thinga-ma-jigger", a Seussian contraption that can sprout wings, pontoons, booster rockets, change size, and do just about anything else necessary to further the adventure. The adventures are prompted by a question posed by either Nick or Sally at the beginning of each episode, which will inevitably lead them around the globe to "make natural science discoveries." Similar to other PBS Kids series such as Curious George and Sid the Science Kid, The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That! focuses on introducing preschoolers to various science and learning concepts, often involving animals and their environments.

These were encoded by me, from my digital recordings off my local PBS station. If you enjoy this torrent, be sure to leave me a comment! And please continue to seed after your download completes, so that others can enjoy this great kids educational show. I have the entire series recorded off television, and if people keep seeding I will continue to post more episodes.
