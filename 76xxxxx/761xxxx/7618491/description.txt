Because I couldn't find a cue file available to split the mix into tracks on the website where it's available for download, I took the time to create one, since I'm poor and can't afford to pay $0.89 for each track.

S3RL has been writing, producing and pushing out his own tracks since the year 2000, and before actually being discovered and able to entert-ain-us with his happy hardcore anthems, he's been knee deep in the rave scene, cutting loose and churning it up with the ravers, as a raver.

S3RL clenched his first break at the end of 2005. He had demo CD's loaded up and ready to pop out, and when Kevin Energy and Sharkey came down under, S3RL dropped one on them... Weeks later, Kevin Energy got back to S3RL with a contract to sign and release his track 'Transformers' on to vinyl under the NuEnergy Collective (NEC) label, 'Relentless' Making him the 1st DJ in Queensland to be signed to a major Hardcore label.

It wasn't until 2006, when S3RL had his first vinyl released and more on their way, that he started actually learning to mix and first excreted on to the DJ scene. S3RL made his first actual splash as a DJ at the end of 2006, squished into a steaming lineup, piled up with names such as Kevin Energy, Brisk, Sharkey, Scott Brown and Neophyte.

Since then, S3RL has layed foundations with numerous more tracks signed to NEC and also sliding his way down from Brisbane into the Sydney label Executive Records, relieving himself of even more rim shattering musical nuggets. All this while playing regularly at hardcore events and keeping true to his raver roots, raving the nights away when he's not flushing out his sound behind the decks.

Now that S3RL has smeared a name for himself and left a mark, there's no skidding to a halt. He'll keep on squeezing out more bowel trembling basslines, phat, chunky beats and explosive melodies that will leave you burning and needing medical attention.
