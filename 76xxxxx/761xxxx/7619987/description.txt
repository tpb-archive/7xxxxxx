I-400 Japan's Secret Aircraft-Carrying Strike Submarine - Objective Panama Canal
by Henry Sakaida, Gary Nila, Koji Takaki
 
Description:
The I-400 'super submarine' was one of the most monstrous creations to emerge from the Second World War and in its time it was the largest submarine ever built. It was considered to have been one of Japan's most secret weapons - indeed the Allies remained unaware of its existence until it surrendered in late August 1945. At more than 400 ft long, weighing 5,700 tons, carrying a crew of 200 and possessing a range of over 50,000 miles, the I-400 carried three Seiran attack floatplanes in a hangar built on to its deck ahead of the massive conning tower. The Imperial Japanese Navy tasked the I-400 with a secret mission to attack American cities and to destroy the Panama Canal. This book is the result of many years of meticulous research. The authors have traced and interviewed three of the original six pilots slated to fly the Seirans on their hazardous missions. They have revealed - for the first time - the story their aircraft being painted in fake US markings for their final mission.The book contains hundreds of astonishing photographs, many previously unpublished, showing the I-400 from both outside and inside as well as its hangars and aircraft.

Japanese Submarine Aircraft
by Tadeusz Januszewski

Description:
 The first English language book to describe in detail the aircraft carried by Japan's extensive submarine fleet in World War Two. More than any other nation, Japan designed, built and operated aircraft launched from submarines, using them for reconnaissance and also (uniquely) for bombing and attack missions. This fascinating history of an under-published aspect of World War Two aviation warfare is illustrated with photographs, scale plans and full colour illustrations.
