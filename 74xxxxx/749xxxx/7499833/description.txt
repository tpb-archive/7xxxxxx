History:

On May 28, 2012 Bryan Lunduke, author of a variety of curious software, posted on his site that if he where to achieve a 4,000.00 US dollars goal of recursive donations in a week he would open source his software. Eight days later he achieved that goal!

A month after the goal was achieved not all software had been released yet, and donations dropped. Another series of discouraging events passed. Events like: Lunduke's developing computers breaking, he going on vacation when most of his software was still unpublished, censoring disappointed people's comments on his blog, and he focusing on other projects that had not to do with his announced goal.

On July 12, 2012 Bryan Lunduke decided to close source further versions of his projects, on the reason that his experiment had proven to be non viable. All free binaries of his software where removed from the his site and only the source code he published remains available for free at www.github.com/BryanLunduke,,, Until now.
