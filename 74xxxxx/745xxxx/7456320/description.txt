"Why The Facts of 9/11 Must Be Suppressed - Understanding the Ruling Group Mind Behind the War Without End,"

with Dr. John McMurtry.


Dr. McMurtry was one of the first academics to analyze 9/11 and the 9/11 wars.  He is Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of of Guelph, Ontario.


Note: this is a rebroadcast of a Guns and Butter episode from March 10, 2010. This time should be a better listening experience since it does not air during a pledge-drive.





================================================

"Guns & Butter" investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, "Guns & Butter: The Economics of Politics" reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself!
 To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
