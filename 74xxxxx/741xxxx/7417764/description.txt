Winrar 4.20 (32bit And 64bit) Pre Activated - [EC]

**********************************************************************************
      
                         Whats  New In v 4.20 ?

**********************************************************************************


general compression algorithm is optimized for better

utilization of several processor cores. While some speed gain
         
is possible even in single processor mode, best results
         
are achieved in multi-core environment.

         
**********************************************************************************

Speed gain depends on data type and average file size.
         
Several cores are utilized more efficiently when compressing
         
large files.

      
b) we had to increase memory requirements to achieve higher
         
   compression speed. General RAR compression algorithm allocates
         
   about 120 MB comparing to 40 MB in WinRAR 4.11;

      

c) RAR text compression algorithm cannot utilize several CPU cores
         
   efficiently, so its performance in multiprocessor environment
         
   is much lower than for general algorithm. Also its decompression
           
   speed is much lower than in general algorithm regardless of
         
   CPU number. So we decided to disable the text algorithm by default.

         
***********************************************************************************


  If you need maximum possible compression ratio for plain text data
         
  regardless of speed, you can enable the text compression
         
  in "Advanced compression parameter" dialog. Press "Compression..."
         
  button on "Advanced" page of archiving dialog to access it.
         
  You can also change this option permanently in default compression
         
  profile;

 
*********************************************************************************        

  Fastest" (-m1) compression mode also supports several processor
         
  cores now. In 4.11 it could use only a single processor core.

  

   RAR general decompression algorithm speed is slightly improved,
      
   though not to same extent as RAR compression. RAR decompression
      
   is not able to use several processor cores, so its performance
      
   does not depend on a number of cores.


*********************************************************************************

                Changes in ZIP compression:

**********************************************************************************

    now ZIP compression supports several processor cores resulting
         
    in noticeably higher performance in multi-core environment.
         
    Single CPU ZIP compression is also faster than in 4.11;

    memory use for ZIP compression is increased to about 15 MB.
