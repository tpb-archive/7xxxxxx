Love is a Grammy Award-winning soundtrack remix album of music recorded by The Beatles, released in November 2006. It features music compiled and remixed as a mashup for the Cirque du Soleil show of the same name. The album was produced by George Martin and his son Giles Martin, who said, What people will be hearing on the album is a new experience, a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period.
