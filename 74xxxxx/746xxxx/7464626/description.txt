ΓÇÿMAKEΓÇÖ is a show created by the publishers of the magazine of the same name. I 
would describe it as a do-it-yourself kit for those who like to build and 
experiment, but not the typical home shelving or brick bar-b-q units for the back yard. Now if you like electronics, computers, experiments of all kinds, then you might want to take a look at these. Some examples of show titles are: Aerial kite photography, Computer Music Making, Kinetic Wave Sculpture, Steampunk, 
and more. Enjoy!
