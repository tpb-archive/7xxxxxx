A young man is imprisoned for killing a close friend, who raped his wife on his wedding day. While in prison, his wife gets pregnant, giving birth to this angelic boy. The wife dies before his sentence is due. In "Angel of Love", Bianang, a frustrated musician, is caught in a tangle of family concerns.
