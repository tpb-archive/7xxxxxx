Lyrics:

I can't help my self but think
what you've done for me day or night
it seems that you are always on my mind
and I know when ever I need you near
I always feel that you'll be there right by my side

Your love runs deep within my soul, and I can't let go
You'll never leave me, because I know
That you are the one for me

You're the one who moves me
You're the one who sees right through me
You're the one I lean on every night and everyday
You're the one who makes feel a brand new life that's so unreal
When I think of you and I, you do
You're the one who moves me
Moves me, oh, you move me, you move me

What I did without your love is a mystery
Now I have you, oh I don't, wanna let you down
Everyday it feels like a dream come true
And I pray that you will always be around

Your love runs deep within my soul, and I can't let go
You'll never leave me, because I know
That you are the one for me

You're the one who moves me
You're the one who sees right through me,
You're the one I lean on every night and everyday
You're the one who makes me feel, a brand new life that's so unreal
When I think of you and I, you do
You're the one that moves me,

When I am down and all alone
You are the one who cares
When I am weak, you make me strong
And I know that you'll always be there, yeah
Moves me, moves me
