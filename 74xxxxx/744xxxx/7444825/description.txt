Lyrics:

How does she know that you love her?
How do you show her you love her?
How does she know that you really
Really, truly, love her?

It's not enough to take the one you love for granted
You must remind her
Or she'll be inclined to say

How do I know he loves me?
How do I know he's mine?

Does he leave a little note to tell you
You are on his mind?
Send you yellow flowers
When the sky is gray?

He'll find a new way to show you
A little bit everyday
That's how you know, that's how you know
He's your love

Everybody wants to live happily ever after
Everybody wants to know the true love is true

How do you know he loves you?
How do you know he's yours?

Does he take you out dancing
Just so he can hold you close?
Dedicate a song
With words meant just for you?

He'll find his own way to tell you
With the little things he'll do
That's how you know, that's how you know
He's your love

He's your love

How do you know?
How do you know?

How does she know you that love her?
How do you show her you love her?
How does she know that you really
Really, truly, love her?

That's how you know he's true
Because he'll wear your favorite color
Just so he can match your eyes
Rent a private picnic by the fire glow
Oh

His heart will be yours forever
Something everyday will show
That's how you know, that's how you know
That's how you know, that's how you know
He's your love
