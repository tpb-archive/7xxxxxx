Time and Chaos is the best CRM contact manager software for Windows users. The relationship history of any contact or client is easily tracked and Chaos 7 improves your time management capabilities with its appointment calendar and to do list tasks that show you exactly what needs to be done today. If you are on a network, Time & Chaos allows you to share your data with everyone on your network with no expensive server add-on required.

* Great interface! Time & Chaos 7 has a classic page where everything appears on one screen, but there are many ways to change up what you see when you need to focus on a certain area. The Appointments view lets you see you schedule by day, week, or month. See Today's look at your upcoming week. Use the new Memos and Lists database for the types of data you just don't want to forget. Most important is that the interface is simple and doesn't get in your way to trip you up as you try to get things done!
* Works with any email software! Chaos 7 lets you link to your current email system for outgoing messages. (If you would like integrated email built in for even more power, take a look at our Chaos Intellect program instead!)
* Easy Networking and Real-Time Sharing! Everyone on the network can use the same databases at the same time and see changes immediately! No additional and expensive server software is required, either!
* Easy to learn! You'll pick it up almost as soon as you turn it on and won't need to go to a class just to get started. Time & Chaos is real world tested by real users, just like you!
