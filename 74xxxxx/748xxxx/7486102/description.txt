Notes: 
 
We Recommend Installing To A Short Path (Like The Install.exe
Default) As Long Path Names Can Cause Missing Files On Certain 
Games During Rebuild.
Unless You Changed It The Default Extraction Folder Install.exe
Creates Is C:/Games/ 
This Is Were You Can Find The Games exe. 
If Install/Rebuild Seems To Freeze Leave It Alone. 
Install/Rebuild Is Normally Very Time/Space Consuming. 
(So Ensure You Have Pleanty Of Space And Patience)
