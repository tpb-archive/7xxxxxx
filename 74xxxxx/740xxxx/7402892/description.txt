Greatest Hits (2008)




This sturdy American blues-rock trio from Texas consists of Billy Gibbons (guitar), Dusty Hill (bass), and Frank Beard (drums). They were formed in 1970 in and around Houston from rival bands the Moving Sidewalks (Gibbons) and American Blues (Hill and Beard). Their first two albums reflected the strong blues roots and Texas humor of the band. Their third album (Tres Hombres) gained them national attention with the hit 'La Grange,' a signature riff tune to this day, based on John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen.' Their success continued unabated throughout the '70s, culminating with the year-and-a-half-long Worldwide Texas Tour.
